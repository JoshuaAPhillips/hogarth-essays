2-12-delius	doc_0_1_0	The purpose of the present essay is not biographical. In his volume on Delius, Mr Heseltine provides an adequate treatment of the composer’s life without the sense of limitation which is inevitable in a shorter sketch. ‘The necessary facts are there available to the student, and some account is also to be found in the standard dictionaries of our time. But if the details relating to the biography of a contemporary composer are definite beyond discussion, the same cannot be said in respect to the critical attitude which one should adopt towards his work. There is no one who is better acquainted with Delius’s utterances and aesthetic intentions than Mr Heseltine, and in regard to the unique position which he occupies I have for his opinions on this subject the greatest respect. On the other hand, the law of averages alone guarantees that some should find a difficulty in identifying themselves exactly with the artistic estimates of another. It is not that Mr Heseltine’s views are here held in question; any such direct contradiction would serve only to reflect the foolishness of the attempt. But it is possible that a perspective other than his may allow an alternate reaction on purely aesthetic lines. From a critical standpoint a proprietary attitude need not confuse the observer. In result, the indication is that although the accuracy of Mr Heseltine’s deductions cannot be questioned without misfortune to the inquirer, it must be realised that, critically and aesthetically, Delius’s works are open to more
2-12-delius	doc_0_1_1	than one opinion; moreover, lack of perception can be the only excuse for estimating as wrong-headed the judgment of another critic simply on the score that it does not happen to be coincident with one’s own.
2-12-delius	doc_0_2_0	The position of Delius, viewed historically, has a particular interest for those whose concern is with an examination of contemporary developments. At a time when romance is, musically, out of fashion, it is a little curious that the close of the romantic movement should be marked by a composer whose magnitude is comparable to few of his predecessors. The history of romance in music begins, to all intents and purposes, with the advent of Weber. He is the first composer whom we can regard with accuracy as an exponent of those principles of musical conduct and expression epitomised by Delius. In one respect there has been a fundamental change of attitude. The music of Weber as seen, for instance, in Der Freischiitz, reflects essentially the spirit of revolution and national endeavour which characterised the internal condition of Germany at the time at which the opera was written. There is in it a vitality of expression which cannot be denied. With Schumann came a change of focus, but the ideal remained; later the inheritance was enriched further by Chopin and Brahms. The early sources of Delius were Grieg and, to some extent, Strauss. But whereas the principal figures of the romantic movement, especially Weber and Grieg, discovered their individuality in music of a character conveniently though vaguely termed “‘national”’ for the purposes of identification, Delius makes no such demands. It is true that some of his music is essentially English in character; for example, his development of the pastoral rhapsody is
2-12-delius	doc_0_2_1	unmistakable in Brigg Fair and some of the smaller idylls. But part of the greatness of Delius is due to the fact that his breadth of conception ignores the limitations of — country or continent. His work is often cosmopolitan. The poetry of his ideas owes little or nothing to academic associations. It may be questioned whether or no this outlook becomes a handicap. To a man musically of small stature it might be so; to Delius the lack of pedagogic restraint spells liberty and not licence.
2-12-delius	doc_0_3_0	The question of immediate derivation, although significant in any consideration of a minor composer, need not concern us too closely in an estimation of the mature work of one whose individuality is so definitely determined. ‘The bulk of Delius’s music is marked by characteristics for which he alone could be responsible. This isolation is in itself evidence of the personal nature of his art. At atime when music, like painting, is suffering from a host of mediocrities, an independent figure must possess a peculiar importance. The best achievements of Delius show clearly that he is unmoved by the fashions of to-day. Perhaps the only other English composer in respect of whom this can be said with certainty is Elgar. This attitude is one of the tests of greatness.
2-12-delius	doc_0_4_0	One must admit, however, that this development of independence, although definite in character, did not come to Delius in his earliest years. Beethoven provides a similar example. The connection with romance is to be found principally through the music of Grieg, in which Delius’s finest characteristic, his art of contemplative writing, had its beginning. But the debt cannot be reckoned as considerable; its importance lies in the fact that it illustrates the link between Delius and the pioneers of the romantic movement. Nevertheless, Delius developed and expanded his art far beyond anything that Grieg could have conceived, and in consequence one cannot insist with reason upon a very close association of ideas.
2-12-delius	doc_0_5_0	If there is to be any clear grasp of Delius’s music in its entirety, the question of texture cannot remain wholly unconsidered. In a former essay we attempted briefly to trace the transposition from the horizontal writing, which is found at its best in the works of Bach, to the more vertical means of expression according to which the major utterances of Beethoven are fashioned. It was the endeavour to illustrate that in our own time vertical writing has gained an ascendancy which is almost complete. In this respect the methods of the twentieth century form a remarkable antithesis to those of the seventeenth. But if Delius in this respect is in accord with his contemporaries it is not owing to an ill-calculated imitation. Should his purpose require it, he can write counterpoint which is both scholarly and musical. It happens, however, that the medium in which the essential poetry of his art finds the most satisfactory expression is not the medium of horizontal writing. To the historian the important point is that Delius’s method is not the outcome of an incapacity to think contrapuntally, though an equally decisive pronouncement would not be justified in the case of some of his contemporaries.
2-12-delius	doc_0_6_0	It is this distinction which encourages the critic to claim for Delius a position elevated above those whose intent is less thoughtful. Like many another genius, he can afford to disregard artistic conventions if it suits him to do so. There can be no denial that his system is attended with danger when pursued by those of lesser ability. It is a remarkable tribute to his capacity for organised expression that his failures are few. Debussy has been equally fortunate. But as models for. their successors the method of neither composer is to be commended, Both have had their imitators, and their disaster is itself a warning and an example to posterity.
2-12-delius	doc_0_7_0	The intensely chromatic character of Delius’s music furnishes another point of interest. Part of this inheritance comes from Grieg, but it may also be traced to Strauss, who in turn had it from Wagner. Admittedly there are works of Bach whose nature is as chromatic as anything which Wagner ever achieved. But with Bach chromaticism is not the rule, and its occurrence is marked by a means of expression entirely different from that employed by the later romantic school. If Delius. sometimes approaches the boundaries of tonality he never places himself irrevocably beyond them. In this respect he marks a development widely divergent from Schénberg. Delius is too clearly a poet to be able to accept dissonance with equanimity, even though in his own works he should admit it when the context is suitable. The reflective nature of his writings emphasises those subjective tendencies which no external stimulus is able entirely to subdue. And since it is in the contemplative music of Delius that the true essentials of his art are to be found, our present concern is with an examination of those works which may be said fairly to represent this aspect of the composer’s creative genius.
2-12-delius	doc_0_8_0	Delius’s biographers appear to be divided in their opinions as to his merits as a writer of opera. It is interesting, perhaps, briefly to compare the verdicts of two critics, whose opposing views with regard to A Village Romeo and Juliet seem fairly to represent the extremities one has to encounter in seeking an impartial estimation of the work. Mr Cecil Gray is at least definite when he says that the voice parts “strike one occasionally as needlessly angular and unvocal.” If this criticism is harsh it has, at all events, some show of justice on its side. In a further discussion of this opera the same writer indicates, with penetrating mildness, that “the composer has not always been completely successful in subordinating the dramatic action to the exigencies ofthe music. Here and there it intrudes itself forcibly, and the operatic conventions have not been entirely eliminated. ‘The work seems at times to hover exasperatingly on the border of two worlds.”
2-12-delius	doc_0_9_0	The opinion of Mr Heseltine appears to be in direct contradiction to Mr Gray’s view. He says: “If opera can be defined as perfect correlation between music and action, then 4 Village Romeo and Juliet is one of the most flawless masterpieces that has ever been given to the world.”
2-12-delius	doc_0_10_0	Between this Scylla and Charybdis the impartial critic has somehow to find his way. In result, one’s conclusions incline to the opinion that Delius’s greatest talents do not lie in the direction of opera. It cannot be allowed that he fails definitely in his handling of drama, but in his rhapsodic works, other than opera, Delius has expressed equal beauty of thought in a form still more compact. It is not to be expected that a composer should find equal success in every medium in which he exerts himself. From a critical standpoint, therefore, it seems wiser to acknowledge these limitations where they occur rather than to falsify the issue with an appreciation which, though it may possess the merit of sincerity, cannot be said fairly to aid the judgment of the discriminating observer.
2-12-delius	doc_0_11_0	Any consideration of Delius’s choral works must be concerned to some extent with a problem, technical and aesthetic, which has become inseparable from their examination. The voice is of all instruments the most flexible, and to define “its possibilities is a task which no critic can attempt with impunity. If, however, the discussion is confined — to practical limits it is a little easier to make an assessment. The practice of music must be, after all, the ultimate test of what is expedient and desirable. The attitude is of considerable importance, because Delius’s methods of choral writing have given rise to two entirely different points of view. It will be our endeavour to present and discuss each of them in turn.
2-12-delius	doc_0_12_0	On the one hand is found the opinion that Delius makes demands upon his voices which might be confined more properly to instruments of the orchestra. This argument is not to be dismissed lightly. If the voice is capable of technical gymnastics, as it certainly is, it does not follow that displays of that character are aesthetically admissible. They must seriously interfere with the architecture of the conception, and, so far from enhancing the effect of the words with which they are associated, are found in result to detract from their power and ordered coherence. There may be a gain in brilliance, but the cost is incalculable. From another angle the procedure cannot be otherwise than detrimental to that formal expression upon which the successful presentation of a choral work of any magnitude depends. One cannot allow that there is more merit in an angular passage of vocal writing than in a less ambitious though more musical structure. It is foolish to decry experiments if they form the basis for definite progress, but when the means becomes the end it is time to raise the voice of protest. Furthermore, the most significant and lasting achievements in the music which forms our inheritance do not depend for their ultimate effect upon doubtful extravagances of a nature purely virtuosic.
2-12-delius	doc_0_13_0	Against this certain critics have advanced, somewhat injudiciously, that it is precisely the instrumental use of the voice with orchestra which distinguishes Delius from all other composers. This argument hardly constitutes a justification. A novel or original expression may serve as an aid to identity, but unless it can show a more significant value the artist who claims the characteristic has not improved his former state. In this respect Delius suffers to an unfortunate extent from those who are eager to associate themselves with his every gesture. It is not, one fears, that these supporters are sensible to the true aspects of his greatness. Too often they betray by their actions a grievous lack of that discrimination which is so essential for the foundation of accurate judgment. But to some minds nothing except an extreme policy will serve. After neglecting a composer for years there is an intense and often irrational movement for his support. The tendency of the present day is to a behaviour of that kind on Delius’s behalf. The composer himself is the last person who would wish to encourage anything of the sort. ‘To the critic whose aim is an estimation both thoughtful and detached, the semi-cultured enthusiasms referred to are a constant despair.
2-12-delius	doc_0_14_0	A further contention which cannot be ignored is that any composer who, like Delius, attempts to expand choral technique is open to an unjust accusation of writing instrumentally rather than vocally. One cannot regard this assertion as more than a half-truth. The history of music illustrates very fairly the extreme possibilities of choral technique. The point is that the character of the voice is a constant quality. It does not grow more elastic with each succeeding generation. Ifa singer finds certain music physically unnegotiable in one century, there is no very clear reason why the process of time should bring about a change of attitude. The discovery of fresh technical ingenuities will not satisfy as an explanation. Composers recognise the limits of instruments, and, if they are wise, learn to respect them. They do not so often recollect that in performance the voice is governed by equal restrictions.
2-12-delius	doc_0_15_0	The power of Delius may be measured in some degree by the fact that despite their acknowledged handicaps his choral works possess a magnificence and grandeur which it would be futile to deny. We cannot ignore, however, that orchestral writing is for him a happier medium. Mr Sydney Grew, in a charming appreciative sketch of the composer, points out that in 4 Mass of Life and, to a lesser extent, in Sea-Drift, Delius is very apt to mistake both accent and sense: “The greatness of Delius is, I feel, transcendental; but in fine points like these he speaks with the uncertainty of a beginner.”
2-12-delius	doc_0_16_0	In Sea-Drift, a setting of Whitman’s poem, one has the feeling that ap essential coherence is somehow lacking, The choral and orchestral writing is, independently, very beautiful, but when heard in conjunction, unity appears to be absent. It is difficult to account theoretically for this impression, which, fundamentally, is a physical association of the concert-hall. The origin is not to be found in defects of performance, The cause, whatever it may be, is of a more significant, though less obvious, nature.
2-12-delius	doc_0_17_0	The Mass of Life has a nobility of structure and breadth of conception which, together with Delius’s fine poetic discernment, almost redeems the work from any of the shortcomings which normally result from the composer’s peculiar vocal treatment. In the opinion of the present writer it is Delius’s greatest achievement in a choral medium. An inspiration of the first order is combined with an architecture both solid and satisfying. In this case admiration may well stand before criticism.
2-12-delius	doc_0_18_0	The ultimate purpose of our quest, which is to discover the most complete and concise expression of Delius’s art, must be delayed, though for a moment only, by a brief consideration of two other choral works. These are the Appalachia, variations for chorus and orchestra, and 4 Song of the High Hulls. In both cases one is sorely tempted to suspend judgment. The feeling is that when confronted by such beauty of expression analysis should be at an end. Appalachia, in its score, is hardly convincing, yet a performance leaves one with the converse impression. The same comment has a partial application to A Song of the High Hills. ‘The latter work has faults beyond dispute; the unevenness in construction and texture cannot escape notice. But its vitality is proof against these imperfections, and for that reason only the most rigorous critics would urge its final disqualification.
2-12-delius	doc_0_19_0	The excursions of Delius into those forms which bring into prominence , solo instrument are not, on the whole, attended with success. The Piano Concerto, even after revision, cannot be considered an example of good or great workmanship. The Violin Concerto is on a different level altogether, but it is for the most part a rhapsody for orchestra which would not entirely lose its beauty were the solo violin altogether absent. To the other works of this class which Delius has attempted this remark has a reference almost similar. One does not feel that the thematic material of the ’Cello Sonata is of sufficient interest adequately to compensate for its vagueness of expression. The second Violin Sonata is, however, more satisfactory. At all events a closer acquaintance with it after several performances brings with it a genuine pleasure to the attentive listener.
2-12-delius	doc_0_20_0	It is not in the operas or in the choral works that one finds a crystallisation of Delius’s poetry, although it is contained to some degree in everything that he has handled. What, then, is left as a reward for the search?
2-12-delius	doc_0_21_0	There are five works for orchestra or small orchestra, all rather similar in character, which more than any other of his compositions are representative of Delius. This group includes Brigg Fair (1907), In a Summer Garden (1908), A Dance Rhapsody (No. 1) (1908), Summer Night on the River (1911), and On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring (1912). If this list had to be extended one would, perhaps, include Paris (1899). But one scarcely feels that this latter work contains any typical utterance which has not been repeated or improved upon in one or another of the five works we have elected to consider.
2-12-delius	doc_0_22_0	Before proceeding to any sort of analysis it may be pointed out that a careful perusal of a considerable quantity of biographical matter by diverse authors has shown one thing definitely: that in no single instance has anyone been found to speak ill of that part of the composer’s work which is purely contemplative, whatever disagreements there may have been as to the value of his excursions into other forms. By that the present selection is in some measure guided.
2-12-delius	doc_0_23_0	Brigg Fair, which Delius has happily described as “an English rhapsody,” belongs to the beginning of that period at which the composer was definitely breaking away from external influence. It is characterised by an extraordinary freshness, and conveys with an acute sensitiveness the atmosphere of simplicity which Delius desires to suggest.
2-12-delius	doc_0_24_0	He alone could have written the opening bars of Brigg Fair. The delicate flute solo and sweeping harp accompaniment form by their economical presentation an ideal prelude to the principal theme. The tune on which the rhapsody is built is a Lincolnshire folksong, collected by Percy Grainger, and given by him to Delius. After the delightfully pastoral introduction the melody is announced in its simplest form by an oboe. Later this is decorated by degrees and woven into a fairly complex harmonic scheme. In that section of the work which is purely rhapsodic there is practically no movement beyond an occasional shifting of block chords by way of harmonising the variation of the original theme. Part of the success of Delius lies in the fact that he invariably selects an appropriate and telling chord when he makes a harmonic change.
2-12-delius	doc_0_25_0	Delius has never been very successful in his writing for brass; only too Often the result has been what the Composer would desire most to avoid, namely, a touch of vulgarity—sometimes even of blatancy. In the present work the variation marked “Slow, with solemnity”’ suffers from this defect. It gives, as it were, a glimpse of Strauss on the doorstep. In fairness to Delius, however, I must add that it has not beep my good fortune to hear a performance of Brigg Fair which has not been execrably bad and an obvious misinterpretation of the composer’s intentions; this work has, indeed, suffered much at the hands of conductors. But even when every allowance is made for inadequate rehearsal and a general lack of perception, it is clear that the variation referred to cannot ever be quite successful.
2-12-delius	doc_0_26_0	Apart from this small grumble one has nothing but praise for the rhapsody. Take, for instance, Delius’s treatment 28 of the folk-tune in the closing bars of the work, which consists of superimposing the richest and most exalted harmonies above the original melody. With the exception, perhaps, of the apex in the Dance Rhapsody (No. 1), Delius has not written a passage to surpass in beauty this conclusion to Brigg Fair, even though one may find examples to equal it in that respect. This admittedly difficult work is charming enough to deserve something better than those public rehearsals of it which are styled performances.
2-12-delius	doc_0_27_0	If in our consideration of In a Summer Garden no reference is made to specific passages in the score, it is because, in the first place, the structure is so far built up of little fragments, though wonderfully compact as a whole, that isolated examples cannot give the clue to the complete work as in the case of the other idylls; secondly, no analysis will serve save in minute detail, and in the present context the process is inadmissible.
2-12-delius	doc_0_28_0	What, then, shall be said in respect of this intimately constructed work; To exhaust further the adjectives copnected with beauty of expression may not convince, and yet, of all the jimpressions that the listener receives, the sense of beauty is strongest. If one takes care not to look for objective impressionism as the foremost consideration, the lines of Rossetti which preface the score may be quoted as indicative of the spirit of the work:
2-12-delius	doc_0_29_0	‘All are my blooms and all sweet blooms of love To thee I gave while Spring and Summer sang.”
2-12-delius	doc_0_30_0	One feels that here Delius’s hand is surer than in Brigg Fair, though in mood the resemblance is strong. Perhaps a partial explanation may be conceived if In a Summer Garden is regarded as coming from the composer without any tangible external stimulus, Be that as it may, it is a very lovely work,
2-12-delius	doc_0_31_0	The first Dance Rhapsody bears some resemblance to Brigg Fair in actual form, and, as in the latter work, the main theme is preceded by a few quiet introductory bars. The theme itself is angular, and at first sight would not appear to suggest many possibilities as regards interesting harmonic treatment. But with this tune Delius works wonders; it is in just such circumstances that his chromatic method is most appropriate In its application. His remarkable capacity for handling the woodwind of the orchestra is here seen to the best advantage. The theme is stated and restated, but always against a shifting harmonic background, so that the listener’s interest never wanes. It may be well to note that the middle section is entirely satisfactory when performed under proper conditions in the concert-hall. Those who know this work only through the medium of the gramophone might be misled into thinking otherwise, The apex of the rhapsody is reacheq in what is surely the most beautiful passage that Delius has written; we cannot hope. to improve upon Mr Heseltine’s description: “The climax of the work is not dynamic, but comes at the music’s ebb, a metamorphosis of the dance theme played by a solo violin against a background of divided strings . ... perhaps the most intense and exalted moment in all Delius’s work.” But with Mr Heseltine one must agree that the Coda does not and cannot come off in performance. It is startling and upsets the reflections induced by the
2-12-delius	doc_0_31_1	contemplative nature of the climactic passage. Nevertheless, Delius has willed otherwise, and in theory one cannot resent his conception.
2-12-delius	doc_0_32_0	Even at this stage of our quest it is becoming clear, perhaps, what is the nature of Delius’s art. In an earlier paragraph reference was made to the compactness of Delius’s artistic expression when seen at its best, and the findings indicated that this crystallisation is not to be found in the operas or major choral works, There remain for consideration two idylls for small orchestra, On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring and Summer Night on the River. It is in these pieces, the finest orchestral works that Delius has written, that this compactness is ultimately to be found. “To anyone unacquainted with his music, the First Cuckoo might be presented as an epitome of his whole life’s work.” Viewed in its entirety this idyll is a flawless gem; its neighbour, Summer Night on the River, is scarcely less so. Both are conceived in the same contemplative mood, but for the benefit of those who have access only to reductions from full score, one would mention that the texture of the latter work is apt to suffer in the process of transcription terms of the pianoforte. y The significant question which naturally arises after any examination of Delius’s work is by what process ig he able to attain, without any trace of decadence, the unusual richness of expression which characterises all his best achievements. ‘The clue is hardly to be found in the texture itself. The score of, for instance, On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring is to
2-12-delius	doc_0_32_1	all appearances extraordinarily clumsy, and yet nothing could be more delicate in actual performance. The vertical blocks of chords which on paper seem so ill-arranged convey sounds of reflective beauty as economical as they are luxurious. Furthermore, there are no ingenious devices whose purpose it is to mislead the ear. Delius does not depart from convention in the demands that he makes upon his chamber orchestra. His scores differ from those of Mozart in the sense that he divides the strings, whereas Mozart does not. On the other hand, divided string-writing is a characteristic which Delius shares with nearly all other composers of to-day, and yet they are rarely, if ever, as successfulashe. The lasting quality of his music is due to something less superficial than an accident of technical expression. It is with diffidence that one puts forward an explanation which may conceivably cover the facts.
2-12-delius	doc_0_33_0	There is no movement in the history of music which has been capable of infinite development without interruption. The classical tradition of austerity and impersonal utterance brought about an inevitable reaction, which resulted in a series of romantic composers. In our own day, apart from the more pronounced disorders of contemporary music, there is a tendency again to the classical outlook. From a musical standpoint the pursuit of romance is not viewed with favour. So it is that with Delius we come to the close of a great movement. In this case the finest developments are to be found in a composer who is apparently the last exponent, as Weber was the first, of those romantic ideals which do not properly belong to the twentieth century. Delius has at his disposal the experience of his predecessors, and, like Bach, epitomises the best of all that has gone before him. To this he adds the wealth of poetry and imagination together with a fine discernment. Without his powerful and extremely individual idiom Delius might have failed. As it is, the magnitude of his genius enables him to summarise, almost perfectly, the essential principles of that movement of which he is so notable a figure. , ;
2-12-delius	doc_0_34_0	As a natural consequence, therefore, it would appear that any further developments in romantic music must be stayed awhile if anticlimax is to be avoided. It is difficult to see how an immediate expansion of this particular tradition could be unattended by misfortune. A somewhat crude parallel may be found in the history of the drama. Certain plays of Beaumont and Fletcher are marked to some extent by a decadence which is the logical outcome of retaining the faults of the Shakespearean model without that genius which enabled Shakespeare himself to triumph over disadvantages otherwise detrimental to dramatic expression. Ford and Massinger emphasised the decay still further. The process is too natural to be remarkable. But it is scarcely possible that the final stages of a romantic movement in music should be unaccompanied by similar dangers. As we indicated earlier, Delius has had his imitators, and their failure has been pitiable. There is little excuse for further disasters.
2-12-delius	doc_0_35_0	By peculiar ill-luck a-combination of circumstances renders the present situation more perilous than it would otherwise be. A leading characteristic in English music to-day is the use and abuse of folk-tunes. There is no help for it; the fact has to be admitted. This comment in no way implies a condemnation of folk-music as music; in a suitable context, unattended by artificialities, it is both charming and delightful. The fault rests with those composers who, suffering apparently from a lack of genuine inventive ability, employ folk-tunes in their works with a ludicrous disregard for what is artistic or appropriate. To such an extent has this culture been developed that almost greater credit is claimed for stealing a folk-tune than for the invention of an original theme. Such a condition cannot be regarded as healthy.
2-12-delius	doc_0_36_0	It is not to be denied that Delius himself has made occasional use of folk melody, and in consequence the less cautious or more arrogant of his supporters feel that they may adopt a more unlicensed procedure with impunity. This presumption on their part brings its own punishment. The bulk of Delius’s music is entirely independent of external melodic aid, and he has never used a folk-tune so that by its association the quality of his work has suffered. Such discrimination 1s, unfortunately, rare in any generation. The difficulty -; that to many people there is in music no clear difference between judicious adaptation and wholesale borrowing. If they would learn to appreciate the distinction a recommendation to a closer study of the matter might possibly meet the case.
2-12-delius	doc_0_37_0	It is hoped that this brief reference to the problem of folk-music will help to indicate the nature of some of those dangers with which the close of the romantic movement is attended. But although the example of Delius may encourage lesser men to extravagance in certain respects, his influence on the present generation is very far from being purely negative.
2-12-delius	doc_0_38_0	By way of conclusion it may be profitable to examine two precepts, both of which find physical representation in Delius’s best work. The first is economy of statement. The critic can hardly overestimate the importance of this virtue at a time when a reverse process is more clearly the order of the day. In his idylls Delius has not written a superfluous note. The number of composers concerning whom one can, with accuracy, make the same comment is lamentably few. Bach set an example which, one might say almost without exaggeration, was forgotten as soon as he was dead. At all events, the standard declined and continued to do so. until comparatively recent times. In the nineteenth century Wagner, consciously or otherwise, made a vigorous attempt to check the extravagances which had become fashionable. Let those who doubt the truth of this assertion examine for themselves the Prelude to Tristan and Isolde or the Siegfried idyll. A careful inspection should convince. Delius carried the development a step farther. In this he is almost alone of his generation. To respect his restraint the curious observer would do well to compare Delius’s method with the less rational demands of Strauss, or in an earlier period, Berlioz. The Requiem of the latter composer, although one of the most magnificent choral achievements the world has ever seen, indicates plainly enough the terms in which men had become accustomed to think. The revival of the chamber orchestra, which is one of the most hopeful signs
2-12-delius	doc_0_38_1	of the present revolution, must be attributed partly to Delius’s influence. It is not simply a question of finance. By his example Delius has shown the extent of what may be accomplished within ordered limitations. The test of greatness is not an ability to express one’s musical ideas on a scale requiring an orchestra of more than a hundred performers. This principle is beginning at last to regain recognition. That it has a practical application no musician of sense can doubt. To practise economy it is not necessary to be a composer of the first order. On the contrary, a lesser man than Delius would do well to confine his thoughts to a moderate means of expression. Therein lies his surest and, perhaps, only chance of ultimate survival. .
2-12-delius	doc_0_39_0	The second precept consists in formal coherence. This quality has never been lacking to those who realise the value of lucid utterance, but its absence characterises the laxness of thought which, in the music of to-day, is more widely spread than one might at first suppose. Delius does not always shape his works according to convention; recurring themes, for instance, are occasionally dispensed with almost entirely. But in whatever form he chooses to express his ideas the structure, with few exceptions, is at least definite. He has often been accused of vagueness in his works, but there is little evidence in support of the charge. The fault is with the listeners rather than with the composer. His texture is, in this respect, misleading to the casual observer. At first sight the angular character of his melodies and the shifting chords which accompany them appear to indicate a lack of stability. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is, fundamentally, a conciseness of expression and exact thought which is clear to all who take the trouble to search for themselves. The idylls for small orchestra illustrate more obviously his capacity for coherence within classical form. The example is too valuable for present-day composers to ignore, Whether or no they profit by it depends upon the rate at which they value a technical equipment which in all ages is equally essential and appropriate to sound scholarship.
2-12-delius	doc_0_40_0	And so it is that we are brought to our conclusion, The value of the present inquiry must be influenced in some measure by individual reaction to Delius’s art. His music is above all things personal. Perhaps it is enough if the nature of our findings can be regarded with justice as unbiassed by controversy. The final purpose is to suggest an explanation which may fairly account for the greatness of Delius. In the writings of an acknowledged authority on the musical problems of our time is indicated more clearly than the present author can hope to do what should be the verdict, and it is not necessary that one should attempt any addition to Dr Dyson’s admirable summary:
2-12-delius	doc_0_41_0	“He (Delius) has at least one quality which is perhaps above all others scarce in our time; he has a deep, a quiet, and an intrinsic sense of beauty. Is it this that our generation has lost or is losing? His idylls On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring and Summer Night on the River, and a dozen other movements of tranquil yet enchanted fantasy, were not born of the tumult of to-day. Like the idyll of Siegfried, they must be tasted without passion, without impatience. Delius is not of the market-place. . . . His is often a rhapsodic art, but still more is it at times an art of pure contemplation. And an art of pure contemplation is not easy to practise in this twentieth century of ours.”

2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_1_0	"Mrs Virginia Woolf, in one of her delightful essays, states her belief that ""we are trembling,"" as she puts it, ""on the verge of one of the great ages of English literature."" I should very much like to agree with Mrs Woolf: it would be pleasant to feel that one was at the dawn of a great epoch; nor indeed is it difficult to discover at the present time much that seems full of encouragement and promise. Our younger writers are undoubtedly daring and sincere, and they seem most anxious to tell the truth about what they think and feel in all sorts of circumstances. They have broken down many of the old conventions, and have banished most of the taboos which used to be so hampering to freedom. There is also to-day a large public which is eager to welcome experiments; nor do I believe that there has ever been atime in our literary history when talent was more sure to meet with immediate recognition. All this, as I say, seems full of promise; but is it enough to justify us in the belief that a great age of enduring masterpieces is about to dawn upon us? Famous ages of this kind are the result of a number of complex circumstances; they have occurred, after all, very rarely in the history of literature, and, according to my reading of that history, they have been due above all to the happy coincidence of two conditions, neither of which can be"
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_1_1	said to characterize our time. In the great periods of Greece and Rome, at the Classical revivals in Italy and France andEngland, as at the Romantic revivals in those countries - and these were the greatest epochs of literary creation - men shared in common certain convictions which they took more or less for granted; and it was the coherence of their beliefs and ideals, the grandiose completeness, rather than the ultimate truth, of their scheme of things, which gave them that imaginative dominion over experience which produces great-ness. They had, in fact, a solution which sufficed them for life's problems,a formula, an agreed convention; it was this that enabled them to handle their material with the ease of masters; and even our predecessors of the Victorian era worked together on a basis of accepted ideas, which we, of the twentieth century, with our miscellaneous, shattered view of the world, are very far from possessing.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_2_0	But even this by itself is not enough.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_3_0	Literature is not a branch of philosophy or of social science; it is an art, and the arts only blossom freely — and how rarely they blossom with any freedom! - under certain technical conditions,and when their material, their medium happens to be in a state favourable to their right development. Great thoughts seem only able to produce great literature when they happen to coincide with a special condition of the means of expression, with what I may call, per-haps, a certain plastic state of language.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_4_0	This plastic state is due either to the unhackneyed freshness of an un-exploited idiom, full of unconscious poetry, and with the dew of the morning, so to speak, upon it-and an unexhausted form of speech like this, as with the Greeks, the Romans and the Elizabethan English, has formed the medium of the supremest literature;or it may be due, as at the Romantic period, to what is called linguistic renovation, to the vigour borrowed from popular speech, and to the revival of an old vocabulary which had fallen out of use. So important is this need of an unhackneyed, expressive diction to give to thought an enduring form,or at least so important does it seem to me (but I am perhaps a faddist on the subject), that I should hardly consider it a paradox to regard what we call the great imaginative periods of literature as being, in fact, linguistic phenomena-incidents, not so much in the history of man's mind, as in that of his language.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_5_0	Of the preoccupation with language,the verbal preciosity and experiment which absorbed so much attention in the age of Ronsard in France, and in that of Shakespeare in England, or of that search for a renewed vocabulary which inaugurated the Romantic revivals in these countries, of any of this kind of linguistic ferment, which is the surest sign of a revival of letters,I can see, however, little or no evidence to-day. Almost all our younger writers appear to be perfectly content with the common and current vocabulary; save for a few almost grotesque aberrations,the diction and style of each of themis indistinguishable, to me at least, from the diction and style of any of the others.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_6_0	The very conditions, moreover, whichI have already mentioned as being apparently so full of encouragement—the widespread interest in literature, the large reading public, the prompt recognition of merit,-all these things are hardly as favourable as they might seem to the development of literary talent.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_7_0	Enduring excellence in any art is not at all a necessary result-it would seem indeed to be more like an accidental by-product-of artistic activity, and a general interest in the art, and enthusiasm for it, often tends, by making it fashionable, to hamper and impede,rather than to foster it. And is not this what is happening to-day? A large number of people who would do well to concern themselves with other things are now led by fashion to take an intelligent, or semi-intelligent, interest in new books; they form enthusiastic cliques, so eager to welcome and make notorious any novelty, that the clever young writer is able to attain recognition much too easily. Success is,indeed, as Trollope says somewhere, a necessary poison; but they are fortunate, he wisely adds, to whom it comes late in life and in small doses.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_8_0	The effects of this easy success - and of the many dangers in the path of the would-be artist, premature success is probably the most dangerous, the results of this quickly won popularity are not difficult to observe all about us.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_9_0	As soon as any glimmering of talent,any freshness of originality, makes its appearance, it is immediately noted and exploited. Editors of the weekly and even of the daily papers seize upon it; they have acquired, one may almost say of them, the habits of cannibals or ogres; they suck the brains of young writers, and then re-place them by a new levy of adolescent talent. Their victims find it easy at the outstart to make money; even the fashion-papers pay them large sums for their little essays; they acquire expensive habits; they are introduced by benevolent patrons into what is called good society, and losing before long, as journalists are apt to lose, the power of reading and of nourishing their minds by disinterested study, they soon exhaust their little stock of originality:they have nothing more to say; their contributions are no longer wanted; anew set of beginners supplants them, to be soon exhausted and supplanted in their turn. I do not mean to suggest that journalism, the habit of rapid composition for the press, is always inimical to talent.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_10_0	Often, indeed, to men of matured minds it is a fortunate incentive, which compels them, as it compelled Hazlitt for instance, to give the world their accumulated treasures of reading and meditation, to pour out the richness of their minds upon paper. But to the young,the inexperienced, the immature, how can this marketing of unripe fruit be anything but injurious?
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_11_0	Publishers also compete nowadays with editors in killing the goose whose golden eggs they live on. As soon asa young author makes a success his publisher urges him to repeat it at once; other publishers are eager to win his patronage, and he is not infrequently offered a fixed income on the condition that he shall regularly provide one or two volumes a year. It is difficult for the impecunious young to refuse these offers; but they stimulate, they indeed necessitate, that kind of hasty and abundant composition which must be harmful to any young writer, unless indeed he is endowed with the supremest talent. A great genius, it is true,born in a great age of literary creation, and finding ready at hand a plastic medium in which to embody his imaginations, is sometimes able to produce abundant masterpieces, one after the other, and to write down without care pages which are destined to endure for ever. But these fortunate epochs occur ever so rarely, and these great unscrupulous artists who, like Shakespeare or Molière,can cater for the market without harm,and blamelessly worship the golden calf on the highest peaks of Parnassus, are so divinely gifted and so exceptional,that they are quite outside all the ordinary rules.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_12_0	It would be invidious to mention names, but in following the careers of the more recent writers whose first books have charmed me, I almost invariably find that their earliest publications, or at least their earliest successes,are their best achievements; their pro-mise ripens to no fulfilment; each subsequent work tends to be a feeble replica and fainter echo of the first.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_13_0	In recent years, and especially since the war, similar conditions have prevailed in France and in America; in these countries, as in England, the number of miscarriages of talent, the rate of infant mortality among gifts of promise,seems to be ever increasing. And indeed, with all the advertisement and premature publicity of our time, where can we hope to find that leisurely ripening of talent in the shade of obscurity, that slow development by experiment and failure, by which it can best be mellowed and matured?
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_14_0	No; the old, hard conditions were surely better. It was much better to stone the prophets than to crown them,as we now crown them at once, with roses. They are stifled by the roses, but the stones in the old days of stoning only drove them out into the desert to meditate on their mission and perfect their gifts, so that they might return at last to take their revenge on the world which had scorned them.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_15_0	"Is all lost then? If we live in an age which demands and abundantly rewards improvisation, but in which the improviser is extremely unlikely to produce enduring work; if all the circumstances of our time seem co-ordinated and organised to smother talent; if Mrs Woolf's surmised dawn is the late twilight that it seems to me, is there nothing to be done but to lay aside our pens and wait till the winter of our inanition be over?Must we console ourselves with the reflection that such winters are beneficent seasons of repose for the human spirit, and that Beauty, after being buried for a while, will shine at its rediscovery — a hundred or two hundred years hence perhaps with a new brightness? Or is there a way of keeping the lamp still alight, and handing it on to others through the dark; a path out of the wilderness, which can be followed under unfavourable as well as favourable circumstances; a means of achieving excellence which is more or less independent of the age one lives in?In that lazy perusal of old books in which I spend so great a part of my existence, I sometimes come on a sentence, a phrase, an image which seems to arouse a faint echo somewhere within me. ""That's for you; make a note of it; copy it out!"" my Good Angel whispers, but too often I pay no attention to that wise admonition. Then afterwards, often days afterwards, some dim reverberation of that"
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_15_1	forgotten sentence begins to haunt me; I begin to feel that some mysterious good had been embodied in it; that it had revealed perhaps the secret of a charm-ing way of life, or had solved some perplexing problem, or had aptly ex-pressed, it may be, some meaning of my own, giving importance to my private thought, and making it more true and lucid. In any case, back through all the books I have been read-ing, I must search for that lost phrase until again I find it.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_16_0	Je trouve au coin d'un bois le mot qui m'avoit fui-”
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_17_0	This line of Boileau's is the latest of these recaptures; and now that I have read it again in the epistles of that old bewigged poet, it creates for me an enchanting picture of a special kind of lettered existence, of a life of toil and leisure, devoted to the development of talent-the life of Horace at his Sabine farm, of Boileau in his garden at Auteuil, of Pope at Twickenham, of Gray in his college rooms at Cambridge. Writer sof this studious kind are more concerned with the conquests than the gifts of art,with what can be achieved by scrupulous correction, by the curious felicity of phrasing, by constant revision, and the assiduous labour of the file. They do not improvise, they are carried away by no sudden fits of inspiration; their industry is rather like that of the laborious bee, to which Horace, the master of them all, compared his toil;and their hives are enriched by the diligently gathered spoil of innumerable flowers. Or, to change the image,we may compare their method to the delicate chiselling of gems; nor is this old comparison an unfitting one, since their verses often possess a gem-like quality which enables them to resist the wrong of time.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_18_0	Although these laborious writers can seldom vie in achievement with the inspired poets of the creative ages, they have for us at least one great advantage;we can imitate them and learn from them, for they have much to teach us. We must honour the genius, and rejoice that he has existed, but we must take good care not to try to follow in his footsteps. The example of the man of genius is, as Flaubert was fond of pointing out, the worst kind of example for the man of talent; and talent and the development of talent amid un-favourable conditions is my subject in this paper. I have spoken of poets; but for writers of careful prose, like Flaubert for instance, or Walter Pater, the methods of cultivating a gift and creating a style are not in any way different.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_19_0	Should the age then provide no great impulse, and beget no genius, talent may still find its opportunity for development; and by the inspiration of technique and the study of the best models it may produce work of enduring value. If the thought of the time we live in gives us no general scheme of ideas and no agreed convictions, we may still be able to discover in our own thought and our own temperament, if we search for it, some point of view which will enable us to dominate our own experience;some meaning which, for ourselves at least, is central and significant. Should the language of the day be set in fixed formulas and moulds, and the vocabulary have lost its freshness, it is still possible to discard those formulas and break those moulds, to make one's own vocabulary and create one's own individual and expressive style.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_20_0	To write as if we were geniuses, and to imitate the easy carelessness of those great men in an age which does not pro-duce them, must almost certainly lead to artistic failure. But to cultivate a talent is always possible; and how many beautiful and enduring works of literature are the fruits of talent brought by labour and care to its utmost perfection! Delightful it must be, no doubt, to live in a great epoch and be hypnotised by it, and become its mouth-piece, to have mighty words, words one cannot help, rush to one's lips in the ecstasy of inspiration; but to shut one-self away from hostile circumstance in some pleasant solitude, and devote the leisure of one's mornings to the lab-our of the file; to search for the word one wants, and then to walk abroad and find it perhaps at the corner of a wood,is not this also a delightful way of living, and may it not be that those who spend their days in this delicate and learned labour taste what are after all the more conscious, the more exquisite,the more aristocratic joys of the career of letters?
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_21_0	But to lead this life, to taste these joys, certain qualities of temper are needed, and the ability is also needed to make certain renunciations. The labour of creating one's own style can only be undertaken by one to whom that labour is in itself delightful; his pains must be his pleasures also, he must love the medium he works in,delight in playing with words and phrases, as the painter delights in playing with his palette and paints and brushes. He must be willing, if necessary, to be poor, for his fastidious pen will not support him, and if he must earn his living he must earn it by other means than those of literature. He must not repine at obscurity,poverty and obscurity are likely to be for many years his companions; nor should he envy too much the early successes of his more popular contemporaries, or of those who are younger than himself.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_22_0	This is indeed an old-fashioned way of life which I find myself recommend-ing; and it is only, I think, by means of a desire, a purpose, an ideal aim which appears to be equally out of fashion to-day, that it has ever been possible to adopt, or at least to maintain, it.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_23_0	The youth of to-day seem to me, as I have said, intensely interested in life;but, if I observe them rightly, it is life more as a means to experience, than as an opportunity for achievement,which absorbs and excites them. To undergo one experience after another,to tell the truth about each, and thus to win the attention of their contemporaries - something of this kind strikes me as being in the main their animating motive. That life can be above all an opportunity for carrying out a pre-conceived plan, for striving onwards towards a distant goal; that it should only be crowned at last, if at all, by that enduring fame which is the final reward of a rounded career,-this is an antique ideal which seems to be so for-gotten now, and even the words which express it sound curiously out of date in our more modern vocabulary.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_24_0	"It is natural enough that, to a generation disillusioned by the war, the notions embodied in high-sounding terms like Fame and Glory should seem some-what pompous and absurd. Perhaps they are so, perhaps all such aims are folly; perhaps those who are devoid of such ambitions are superior, as they certainly are more amiable and easy-going, human beings. Only-and this is the point I want to emphasize - we must not expect them to leave much enduring work behind them. Unless an artist regards achievement in his art, and the lasting fame it brings, as infinitely worth while, esteems it as far above immediate success and the applause of his contemporaries, unless he be sustained and spurred on, and, if you like, deluded, by a faith, a fanaticism, a folly of this kind, he is not in the least likely to maintain his purpose,striving ever onwards towards that excellence which, we are told, ""dwells among rocks hardly accessible, and a man must almost wear his heart out before he can reach her."" Fame mayThebe the last infirmity of noble mind, but the noblest minds whom Time has crowned with enduring laurel have seldom been untouched by this brave fever. With what a passion the ancientGreeks loved fame, and how abundantly was that love rewarded! κλέα ἀνδρῶν the game of great deeds which might reach heaven was the high incentive of the Homeric heroes; the thought of it inspired Pindar's odes;and Plato expressed the feeling of this most glorious and vainglorious"
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_24_1	"people,when he made the wise Diotima exalt the love in mortals of immortal fame,saying that she was persuaded ""that all men do all things—and the better they are the more they do them—in the hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue,for they desire the immortal."" With this fine passion the Greeks infected the Romans, handing it on to the nobler among them as a spark of divinest fire. It flashed out again at the Renaissance from the ashes of antiquity; and theFrench, with their love of la gloire,have carried on this, as they have other classical traditions. When the most famous of French critics comes to depict a character devoid of ambition and the love of fame, he notes the absence of this high and animating motive, this desire to excel, which, he says, elevates men above themselves,and sustains them through a whole life-time of honourable activity-he notes a deficiency of this kind as a grave default, and as a sign of poverty of spirit. It is easy enough, Sainte-Beuve says, to miss fame by not believing init; and this, in my analysis of their plight, seems to me likely to be the"
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_25_0	fate of our younger generation. With the love of fame, the desire to appeal to a more permanent audience than that of one's immediate contemporaries,the other unfavourable conditions of the time, however discouraging, would present no insuperable difficulties; the temptations of money and immediate success could be resisted; but if writers have no belief in lasting renown, and no desire for it, if they produce their works only for the day's consumption,how can they expect to win enduring reputations? it being useless, as Schopenhauer pointed out, for pastry-cooks to appeal to posterity.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_26_0	Fame indeed is seldom with us so conscious, or at least so openly avowed,an object of ambition as it is in France,and we possess no exact equivalent for the French term la gloire. But the ideal of which fame is the old and
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_27_0	consecrated symbol, the desire to leave behind one something which the world will be unwilling to let die, and thus to live on in the thoughts of succeeding ages, has been, though they may not have so often confessed it, a most potent incentive to our greatest English writers.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_28_0	What I am writing sounds no doubt rather priggish; and I am perfectly aware that it is in a way ridiculous for little mortals to be so anxious about their puny performances and their insignificant reputations. All such thoughts are chilled at once when we reflect on the almost certain in-difference of posterity, or extend our cogitations as far as the next glacial epoch. But the desire for enduring renown, though rooted in the egotism of our vain human nature, reaches upward towards more permanent things,and bears fairer fruit upon its branches.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_29_0	"Fame, as Hazlitt, the least priggish of our critics, declared in his panegyric of that passion, is not popularity, the shout of the multitude; it is the spirit of man surviving in the minds and thoughts of other men; and the love of it is, he says, only another name for the love of excellence; or it is ""the ambition to attain the highest excellence, sanctioned by the highest author-ity-that of time."" ""Fame,"" another critic writes (and I cannot deny myself the pleasure of copying out this eloquent passage):"
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_30_0	Fame, as a noble mind conceives and desires it, is not embodied in a monument,a biography, or the repetition of a strange name by strangers; it consists in the im-mortality of a man's work, his spirit, his efficacy, in the perpetual rejuvenation of his soul in the world. When Horace-no model of magnanimity-wrote his exegi monumentum,he was not thinking that the pleasure he would continue to give would remind people of his trivial personality, which indeed he never particularly celebrated, and which had much better lie buried with his bones. He was thinking, of course, of that pleasure itself; thinking that the delight, half lyric,half sarcastic, which those delicate cameos had given him to carve would be perennially renewed in all who retraced them. Nay,perhaps we may not go too far in saying that even that impersonal satisfaction was not the deepest he felt; the deepest, very likely,flowed from the immortality, not of his monument, but of the subject and passion it commemorated; that tenderness, I mean,and that disillusion with mortal life which rendered his verse immortal. He had ex-pressed, and in expressing appropriated,some recurring human moods, some mocking renunciations, and he knew that his spirit was immortal, being linked and identified with that portion of the truth.
2-8-prospects-literature	doc_1_31_0	Such, then, is the incentive which those who do not believe in it run the risk of missing. Is a purpose of this kind lightly to be disregarded? Among all the things that men live for, is the eternity of their thought, or such eternity as earth can give, their least worthy object of desire? Was not Renan right when he said that glory after all is the thing which has the best chance of not being altogether vanity? And even if fame be nothing but a shadow and an illusion, and those who it shadows also, yet surely pursue of all illusions it is the most illustrious,being the image and symbol of the highest excellence. To love fame is no merely egotistic passion; and indeed were it otherwise, were a man's attempt to make his name immortal nothing but a mad and private venture, ought we not to prize it even so for the insolence of so vainglorious a design? Should anyone be touched to-day by this old infatuation, and find himself among the lovers of enduring fame, he may reflect,at least, that nowhere else could hebe in better company. And, anyhow, is not life more interesting, is it not more of an adventure, and (if we care to use the old-fashioned word) may we not call it nobler, if we have some impossible aim to live for, some ideal purpose,however unavailing, to animate our dust?
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_0_0	THE ENJOYMENT OF MUSIC
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_1_0	There is pleasure in writing of the enjoyment of music; for numbers of people really do enjoy it. What other joy has life that is at once so enlivening and so enduring? Dr Johnson denied that a man could be completely happy unless he were drunk. Music is not afraid even of that comparison. Its intoxicating pleasures are better than those of common intoxication because they release better faculties; they bring discovery, not forgetfulness; they reveal a world which remains when they are gone. Milton’s description of poetry, the “simple, sensuous, passionate,” belongs more properly to music; for music is as sweet to sense as sugar to a child. But of many advantages that hearing has over taste, the chief is an insatiable appetite; here quantity and quality for once have called a truce. The charm of a note of music comes of the roundness and singleness of tone which fit it to mingle with other notes in a melody; the charm of a melody turns to ravishment when two melodies are heard together. The palate discriminates and is satisfied; the ear discriminates that it may combine. The pure note has the simplicity of the seed, a microscopic point of life, inviting development, implicating the world. It fascinates by its mysterious faculty of attraction, expansion, transformation.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_2_0	Our satisfaction in this delight is clouded when we reflect that we do not wholly possess it. Why is this essay written in a mist, why are not the elements of music clear and familiar to us all? We were all taught the difficult accomplishments of speaking and reading, but never to distinguish sounds, to recognise their musical relations, to construct the scale. Therefore, although we may have learned how music comes by its forms and phrases, though we may feel their meaning, they are a foreign language to us. We are like nursery children, understanding the gist of what is said to us, unable to say a word for ourselves. If we are to possess music, if there is to be an end of the pitiable mute groping which passes for possession nowadays, the seeds of sensibility must be planted in us in childhood, and the tender plant fostered that it may grow in us as we grow.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_3_0	It is strange that the musical alphabet is not generally taught; for it has singular beauty, exercises the mind in science and in art at once, is not, on its mathematical side, so dull or so difficult as arithmetic, and can teach us, as we acquire it, something of the sympathy and compensations which are the source of harmony in all created things. The Greeks, who only surmised what music might become, imagining a perfection of which they never found the key, saw in it a value for education to which we, with the perfect instrument in our hand, are blind. We fill our children’s heads with knowledge that other people have lived on, and have no time left for a knowledge which is life itself. But this is being changed; and in the meantime there is consolation in reflecting that music, unpossessed, can still be enjoyed.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_4_0	Indeed, as things go, the unmusical often seem to enjoy it more and judge it better than the musical. It was much the same with literature before literature was the world’s. When books are rare, mere reading is a virtue, and standards of excellence are accepted which common sense would disown. A book will be valued because it is difficult or has been very often read. Specialisation breeds pedantry, and specialisation is even more stifling to music than to literature; since literature, describing the world, invites its judgment, while music, describing nothing, is at the mercy of those who have nothing but music in their heads. The curious ornithologist does not hear the robin’s song for wondering whether the bird is a cock or a hen; the connoisseur distinguishes Bach from Handel in the first bar and goes on distinguishing to the end of the piece. We, who are less engrossed, can be more impartial; we receive music into a context and divine its meaning by what we have discerned of the meaning of all else. However musical we become, that will still be our most fruitful occupation.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_5_0	In all experience the value of what we receive depends on the value of what we bring. Sound is a summons to attention, a blow on the head. It presupposes a mind dwelling elsewhere. The blind, quickest at discriminating one blow from another, are the last to understand where the blows come from; their sense of significance lacks the broadening, corroborating influence of the visible world. Many a renowned composer is in the same predicament. His genius for interthreading sound with sound possesses him until he breathes and feeds for that alone, and instead of a poet becomes a weaver.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_6_0	The roots of musical susceptibility strike deep, as we see in the familiar reactions of the animals. The horse trembles at the bugle-call, the snake is charmed by the flute, the dog whines and sickens when the violin is played; and birds, whose life is music, have a general code, warning and calling to one another in significant notes which need no interpreter. Men have lost these primitive reactions. Business, culture itself, obliges them to specialise, and nature’s wholeness disappears. Yet the faculty, however deeply buried, never dies; the corpse turns in the grave. The extreme Victorian gloried in the crude resolution of his German bands; and, to this day, when in church or chapel the hymn is sung, the raw voices, the distempered organ, wrest sweetness from the sweetness of the hour. Blake never forgot the singing of the Charity School children, massed under the high dome of Paul’s, when “like a mighty wind they raised to heav’n the voice of song”; and his contemporary, Haydn, noted in his diary: “I was more touched by this innocent and reverent music than by any I ever heard in my life.” He was listening with the native ear, and found his art close beside him, because he so little expected to find it there.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_7_0	I took my gramophone into the woods one romantic summer morning and played Strauss’s Morgen, with Elizabeth Schumann singing, under a beech-tree’s
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_8_0	shade. A pair of pigeons were cooing in an oak near by, the air was mild, and intermittent drops of rain were forming and falling like a dew. So trance-like was this music in such a setting, that a farmer, passing with his dray along the adjacent high-road, stopped to listen, and moved away reluctantly when it was done; he must have supposed that the trees had regained their voices and the Dryades come back! And how much did he apprehend of the dropping melody as it floated between the leaves and mixed its radiance with theirs? His mind, a vague hum of country sight and sound, a hedgerow tangle, was of a sudden smitten and invaded by achieved serenity; he heard

2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_10_0	Not that he followed the music: the words were German, the melody threads its way between the accompanying instruments, the sound flowed through him, effacing itself as it went. Yet the suspicion of an unearthly presence broke the crust of his thought, significant in the very fact that it was unseizable, by its remoteness piercing him. Never again could the summons be so imperative, never could it fall on hungrier soil. It is part of the art of listening to cultivate a hunger; when we most need music, it most comes home to us.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_11_0	I say the art of listening, for listening is, necessarily, an art. How are we to focus attention, to fix ourselves and hold our own in this transparent, undulating medium, how shall we reach down and seize those mystic shapes of changing colour that strew the ocean floor? Pray first for relaxation, leisure. Music has nothing to say to a man with an appointment. It is a holiday pastime, powerless unless permitted, unless invited, to repeat itself. Unfolded in time, it comes upon us like the rising tide, wave after wave, the encroaching rim continually nearer, till on a sudden we look round and find shining water where lately there was barren sand, Duration is the first quality of musical pleasure; the most endearing movements do not close-pack their ecstasy, they sustain and prolong it. The pleasure of watching a machine at work is in its swift accomplishment; the mere revolution of wheels in emptiness would be depressing. The pleasure of watching a stream is in its infinite contentedness; we are rocked by the charm of the water and made one with it. In music, similarly, we begin with an element whose very being is delight; we rest in this delightfulness, we long for its continuance.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_12_0	The medium, then, is pleasure. Musical sound satisfies the ear, charms it to attention; and the secret of the charm is that it admits no extraneous disturbance, that it evokes no image, suggests no object—that all the signs point inwards. The sounds of the natural world, the cries of animals, are like dramatic gestures, with a concentrated meaning which they instantly declare; they convey as they fly an image of the circumstances that evoked them; they are representative and therefore unmusical. They could not concentrate meaning unless sound were a natural means for conveying it; but their aim is to pass from sound to meaning. The aim of music is to dwell upon the meaning in sound. The listener’s attitude is a meditative, trance-like elation; he has no desire of communication with the world; his mind has discerned an element in which it can move unhindered and commune with itself.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_13_0	"Whether music is rational because we understand it, or we rational because we understand music, let philosophers decide. What is certain is that every note has its affinities and antagonisms, and that we can feel and enjoy their strife and amity as we hear them, however little we may know of the cause. Curiously enough, the sound we have called ""single,"" meaning by that ""not mixed of different kinds,"" reveals, as we closely listen to it, in its seeming singleness a composite nature. We find that it carries within it reduced images of itself, like the great waves at sea, crisp every one of them with little waves of the same pattern. The scale in music is an association of these derivative notes, these lesser waves. Each has its direct or secondary relation to a founder. The remoter the kinship, the more urgent the desire for reunion. In simple melody the founder, the key-note, comes first and last, the point we set out from is the point to which we are led back; but its place in the procession is immaterial; its influence is paramount everywhere; it is the centre and source of all significance."
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_14_0	To measure the range of the musical vehicle we must further reflect that every note of the scale can be a founder in its turn, and that the scale it founds need not repeat the notes of the old one. Then every note of these new scales founds other scales, and so on, in unending series. Coil upon coil, we are launched on a perspective of vanishing refinement; what shall we do with this throng of candidates for discrimination when we have but five fingers on each hand? An infinite series of notes is a temptation and a nuisance; we want something that we can control. It was the achievement of the greatest of musicians to confront and solve this problem. By delicate manipulation of nature and cunning persuasion of the ear, Bach coaxed the serpent to swallow its tail, fixing twelve rungs at equal distances on the ladder, and proving them equally trustworthy by trusting them equally himself. These are the makeshift notes we find on the piano, Their meaning is intensified by their relation to a reality which partially eludes them, but which they substantially express. The pianist “holds infinity in the palm of the hand ” with a vengeance, and has tamed the infinity he holds.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_15_0	Significance, we saw, turns, in a melody, on the changing stresses of the notes as they are drawn to a common centre. ‘heir gradated attractions do not follow the order of high and low, they expose more personal affinities; their meaning is directly felt. Its gradations announce themselves so clearly that we do not think of measuring them or even of inquiring how to do so. But then, as the musical design expands, confusion invades our souls. Appeals are made to feeling which imply the retention and possession of previous appeals, and the intellect interferes, explaining and tabulating our impressions by standards of its own. For pleasure’s sake, the problem of attention, the listener’s problem, must be tackled a little more closely: on what principle are melodies combined with melodies, what cohesive power has music, enabling its meanings still to grow? The truth is that we now find between melody and melody the stress, the pull, which we previously found between single notes; but the stresses are concealed from most of. us because the span of attention implied in them is very wide. We have now subsidiary gravitational centres dependent on the chief, we have groups of notes, each with their own system, drawn towards the main system groupwise. In music, one might say, as in architecture, all weight comes ultimately to ground; only in music, where the ground is the key, there is as much building below ground as above it. So, in order to follow the developing stresses
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_15_1	which constitute a great design in music and convey the meaning, we must cultivate the sense of what is called “tonality,” the sense of the gravitational level; to understand a composition, we must distinguish the levels j, employs and appreciate their equilibrium in its quality and in its symmetry,
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_16_0	A specially lucid and convincing illustration may be seen in the first movement of Beethoven’s Pastoral Sonata, Beethoven first establishes the meditative atmosphere he wants by gently thrumming the key-note for twenty-four bars. The exposure of the floor-level becomes, in this way, a feature of principal interest in the lay-out of the design. Then, at the critical point of furthest departure from the level and vital return to it (circa bar 220), he persistently and emphatically thrums another note, proclaiming for nearly forty bars another level—sheer waste of labour, should he convince us, should we accept this level as our true foundation. But that we have not accepted it is proved by our delight in the simple release he contrives, when a door opens and in two steps we are delivered from the ominous crypt and restored to daylight and tranquillity.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_17_0	The point is this: that as, in a melody, our ear measures the sounds by their relation to the key-note and is not satisfied till they flow back at last to their source, sO, in a composition, with its different sections in different keys, we still feel (however little we know or can explain the feeling) one consistent, comprehensive pull, revealed to us as change follows change by varying degrees of relief or embroilment, by images as of departure and return, by movements of surprise, refusal, suspense, anticipation, victory; and it needs to be dwelt upon, because a change of key is often so pleasing as sheer sensation that we may easily suppose the sensation to be its object. Sometimes we should be right; modulation is sometimes the mere prolongation of pleasure. But pleasure itself depends on structure; the pleasure which comes at a moment of change lives and lasts by what we have changed from, by what we change to; the body of it still implies those related planes, that single anchorhold, the level restored where it has been abandoned, or abandoned in order to be restored.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_18_0	Take a second example from Schubert’s Trio in Bb, which, thanks to the gramophone, has become public property. What influence gives the first chord of that second melody its lulling richness and the whole its luxury of peace? The piano, you recollect, runs up a chromatic scale and passes its top note to the ’cello, which holds the note and prolongs it in solitary reverie; then comes the change, with the sense of a new level taken, or rather with a sense not so much of the new as of the necessary; for the level we are launched upon is the level we were waiting for, the level we required. On reflection, or, better still, if we play the movement over from the beginning, we find that the passage preceding the change is a deliberate preparation for it; we have been, literally, “keyed up”; with gathering severity and agitation in the chords and arpeggios, the tonality has been lifted step by step, from F to C, from C to G, from G to D, from D to A, and at A it has remained just long enough to give the ear some illusion of a repose there. But there can be no true repose in the key of A when the piece is in Bb; as well wear a poppy on primrose day. We long for the extinction of the irrelevant spot of hectic brightness; it is because the new chord smooths the disturbance away that we find it so
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_18_1	delicious, so assuaging.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_19_0	The charm of pure sound, the mystery of the relation of one sound to another, their concealed meanings, are naturally the first things to attract the mind as it meditates upon the pleasures of music or calls on memory to renew them. Yet they are not really the beginning. There would be no music but for a more fundamental influence, shared by sound with the being that perceives it, separable from it as the frame of the loom from the woven tissue: rhythm. Sound itself is simply the condensation of a series of rhythmical vibrations into an image; a note is a pulse, a system of sympathetic pulses, all so rapid that our minds cannot count the movements, can only register the results. Rhythm runs everywhere, everywhere translating motion into perception or into power. Sight is rhythm as well as hearing, life as well as light. The atom is a power-scale with, for key-note, an invisible sun. ‘The pure tone of music is a symphony, melody and harmony are the unravelling, the augmentation, the adaptation to our sense of forces implicit wherever sound is heard. So, in submitting sound to rhythm, we do but plunge it a second time in the fountain of its birth, and there is no room for surprise if the impact of music upon the soul provokes thoughts of hidden identities, breeds a presentiment that the forms of death and life are one, touches us with awe as before disembodied spirit or in the suspected presence
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_19_1	of a ghost. For the power that possesses it, possesses us. It exists by dividing time and so do we. A piece of music is a note’s adventure, its life, growth, death; our sympathy is directly elicited; we are in the same case. Music is called imitative, “‘most imitative”; but its bond with us is closer than any imitation. Its meanings move from within outwards like our own, evoking analogies, not depending on them. Its essence penetrates the world, for it is underivative, a part of the original creation.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_20_0	Is it because of this ultimate affiliation of rhythm with life that the simplest exposure of the rhythmical frame of a composition is often associated with the most haunting musical effects, so that the throb of the melodies will remain with us, colourless yet convincing, when their sounds are gone? Beethoven begins his Violin Concerto with five soft strokes on the drum. There are no two bars of common time that cannot be accommodated to that figure. But he endows it with penetrating individuality,and instead of using it to support or introduce the melodies, as one might expect, uses the melodies themselves to establish and perpetuate the surprising tyranny of this “one, two, ra three, four, five.’ In Schubert’s famous C major Symphony two of the a movements develop, diversify, and vitalise rhythmical motives which, in description, sound even balder. The pastoral Andante, which seems to muse and saunter, indolent and tireless, like a stream in enchanted meadows, sustains itself upon a reiteration of two crotchet-beats, as if it were the stream that spoke and said: “‘I flow on, because my banks contain me.” ‘The impetuous finale draws its range from its rhythm still more decisively. Its “one, two, three, four”? rocks and dominates the sense with an insatiable, joyous eagerness, measuring the miles traversed or to be traversed like the wheels of some great continental express for ever journeying westward.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_21_0	The importance of rhythm in music is paramount; it links the musical with the unmusical, if indeed anything can in the last resort be called unmusical; and in view of this universality of its operation, an amateur may be allowed to make a practical remark. There are two attitudes to rhythm among musicians, both grounded on the observation that its basis is a uniformity,—which one respects, the other conceals. Now, in Nature of which music is a part, uniformity never palls; her staying power is inconceivable; her great effects are given by a fringe of the variable thrown against oceanic immensities which never change. Restless humanity is apt to forget the ocean and imitate the ripple on the shore. The genius of rhythm, therefore, is with that musician who feels in each bar, as it passes, its identity with the other bars with which it is in series, and is chary of tampering with the continuity which is one of the conditions of his structural span. Of course, there is no rhythm without living appreciation of what is unique in the passing bar; but every blade of grass has its uniqueness; and so, though rhythm is life, though life is change, the true translation of these facts into music demands massive regularity in the measure qualified by a variability continuous, yet almost imperceptible.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_22_0	Music is separated from most of us by a barrier formed of the hypnotic influence of words. Because its meanings do not take the verbal channel, we allow ourselves to doubt their authenticity, much as people doubt also the speaking expression of a dog, though it says what he means more convincingly than any words could say it. This is a vice of habit. Words convey our meanings so commonly that meaning becomes for us something that words convey. Yet what are words but shadows? The intent mind flies ahead of them. The mechanical inventor thinks in materials, resistances, velocities, grasping an unmade fact which words can describe only when he has made it, as the map shows where the river runs. Musical thought is, in the same way, synthetic, creative; with the combinations it discovers the mind penetrates fields of reality unknown before. Knowing them, we can talk of them, can trace the course they have taken, finding, as we do so, what blundering things words are. But the main fact is that a fresh spring js rising, that the river of life has gained a tributary.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_23_0	The listener’s first care, therefore, must be to throw off the verbal chain; and curiously enough, programme music helps some people to do this, since it is music which half accepts the chain, half slips it, and so suggests to them, in their unhappy captivity, what slipping it means. ‘The pitfall of such music is not that it leads us to search for the kind of significance which we find in events or ideas or accounts of them; but that it leads us to expect music to build up its significance in a historical or poetical order, instead of in its own.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_24_0	Words range among familiar topics, they assume a known world. Music assumes nothing, it unfolds a world out of a note. That is why the phrases come back and come back in constant repetition. Repetition is to music as the leaves and branches to the tree. The life of the tree, entering into every leaf, gives all one pattern, and as the power of it drives here and there to open the leaves on this and that side to the light, new shapes appear of corresponding branches, the new still sympathetic with the old. So the tree grows on, lifted gradually higher, reaching out with knitted power in broader expanse, building ever upon itself. Music has the same vital identities and continuities.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_25_0	Programme music, which is half land, half water, hinders rather than helps a voyager to the manner born. It is a derivation from secondary associations, it abandons pure feeling, the natural mould of sound, for people who have had feelings or objects which have occasioned them, and follows, in its course, the accidental adventures of the people and the objects instead of the organic development of the feeling itself. But in all our activities the mind gravitates to what is most comprehensive; it will not accept the less when it can have the greater. Obviously the nexus of a programme means the narrowing, the restriction, to one interpretation of a material susceptible of many; to use philosophic jargon, it is the particularisation of a universal. Where music would present the “idea,” the programme singles out a special case, and from a succession of such cases makes a chain of which singularity is the thread. It is a defect of vocal music that the words are often a mere thread on which a series of musical suggestions is strung. ‘That never happens when the theme suits the composer; the words then fall into their place as a singularity which the music illuminates and encloses. Programme music is song without words; the conditions of success and failure are the same as in song. But since there are no words, the music must hang together of itself, in spite of the dislocating suggestions; and, for this, it must have structure of a kind
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_25_1	no programme can give it. In fact, when it succeeds, it does not substitute imitations for coherence, but combines the two, presenting the argument and the exemplification in a breath. Till Eulenspiegel, described by Strauss as a rondeau, is packed with the most spirited and ingenious thematic transformations; the same succession of intervals supplies half a dozen different tunes; one never knows in what form or combination to expect them next, That suits the character to be portrayed, and it also makes portrayal possible by providing a musical framework into which fantastic irrelevancies can be introduced without disjointing it.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_26_0	The order of events in music differs from the order of events in time, because in time events occasion feelings, whereas in music the feelings are the events The second movement of Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony being a funeral march, we are sometimes told that the hero dies between the first movement and the second, and that in the third and fourth he must be dead. The scherzo is compared to the light music with which military bands “blow away the cobwebs,” and the finale is called an apotheosis. Of course, composers, even the greatest, constantly use programmes, knowing that they have got music, a totally different thing from attempting, as the crowd and even as some critics do, to get music by using programmes. The scherzo is certainly a relief after the march, but what kind of relief? There is no music in mere contrast; the elements contrasted must converge, must contribute to some : single perception. What seems cobweb-light in the scherzo is really compact of fire and fury; mourning is gone but not heroism; the tragedy of life has been plumbed, the flame of resolution burns more fiercely; and that nothing is forgotten we know when in the Trio the horns prolong their last meditative note and bring back all that the dead march has said. Then the finale—how hard it is to end a work! The listener’s attention is in decline, but the claims of the music are still rising. An accumulation of experience must now be
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_26_1	rounded off, released; the vessel which has been built must be launched; the long-riveted mind demands its liberating reassurance. We feel all this the more at the end of the Erotica, because the movement does not wholly satisfy us; a failure is easier to analyse than a success. The sense of easy mastery in its chief theme is not the ease of heroic achievement. Beethoven had a fancy for this tune and overlooked its limitations. It gives him happy scope for the farewell to energy, when he breaks it up into parts and sets one to chase another. but the farewell to tragedy anq the transcending of tragedy are algo at. tempted, and these fail.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_27_0	If the Eroica can help us to dig. entangle the musical from the historical, the subtler differences between the musical and the literary may be illustrated in another symphony, where again the “programme” had its influence, but in a more poetical way; that Fifth Symphony, in which fate and free will meet like blazing comets caught from opposing fields of heaven into the influence of one sun. Volumes might be written about the first movement alone, but the crux is yet again in the scherzo. When it begins we have already had two profound and complementary experiences, A defiant display of Promethean force has been followed by a long lyrical expression of devotional ward, our minds must be satisfied with a subtler, our feelings with a more searching, appeal; that is the musical situation. So, in the scherzo, the thought of fate, instead of assaulting, steals over us, like darkness in a solitary place. Hardly has its eeriness possessed us before the stillness is broken by a trumpet-call, and at last a spirit of boisterousness and drollery invades the scene. What is the connection between these motives? what common element makes them one? ‘To describe them in words is merely to emphasise their differences. The first has been compared to the passes of the mesmerist, the third to the gambolling of elephants, the second in its defiance recalls the knock of fate. To find their kinship we must abandon metaphors of imitation and view them from within instead of from
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_27_1	without. Associations of resemblances are a poetical expedient; music takes us straight to the reality by evoking one after another the feelings which the reality would evoke, The first reaction to eeriness is self-assurance, as we see in the cock who crows when he is afraid to prove that he is not so; the second is diversion, as when animals that do not love the dark grow playful as darkness comes on, to escape the sense of the uncanny. It is upon psychological affinities as deep and elemental as these that the music of the scherzo is built up. The second and third themes corroborate the first, the three together complete the suggestion of a mystical, a “‘numinous”’ presence, and deepen the suspense out of which the triumph-song of the finale is suddenly to be hurled. There we see again the intoxication of the musical windoff displacing in the composer’s mind something of the intimacy, the profundity, the splendour of his assembled forces. Its majestic masterfulness has a flavour of the impetuous, the exuberant, the careering; its exultant crash and dash have their moments of inadequacy.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_28_0	In early days the severer problems of construction and interpretation did not exist, since music was only known as accompanying some kind of action. A glove has a peculiar but not a perplexing shape; it fits the hand. So with the old music; its forms were dance forms, it meant what the dance meant. The dance was figured, the music followed the pattern, sustaining and decorating it with a-meditative comment, and gradually the attractions of the comment outweighed those of the dancing, When the revellers paused to listen, instrumental music was born. It did not cease to be a dance though hand and glove had parted company, though the actors and the actions were withdrawn. The mind was now the threshing-floor; the old boundaries were gone. But the sense of a ritual remained; for how could lyrical expression live without it? and ritual implies a theatre, an Occasion a celebration, a temple, a divinity, So music, the service in the temple, haq now to build the shrine and reveal the god,
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_29_0	Behind our enjoyment there is always that problem lurking: whose is the temple? what are the rites? Our delight is incomplete till we can tell ourselves what we are delighting in; and lest it should seem fatuous for a man to be happy and not know why, let us remind ourselves that it is our usual condition. Musical pleasure is a direct contact with reality, like seeing a fresh face; and how many of us when we see a face see the man behind it? Music made itself known at first, even to its composers, by association with other things they knew, conventionally; the deeper impulse, which bade it grow like a tree and unfold form and meaning out of itself, was a slow divination of the most original minds. We need not be downcast, therefore, if it is not always easy to follow them; part of the difficulty comes of the very nature of sound in itself. Its quick pliability, its faithfulness to feeling, lead us to suppose that it can take any form that feeling takes, and we forget that hearing is but one form of feeling and that the physical conditions impose their rules, Sound has its natural limitations. We must love it for what it is, as we love water in rain or sea or fountain, or as we love fire, each beautiful, each limited in beauty. Music indeed is elemental, revealing the inapprehensible as the garment reveals its wearer, assuring us of living goodness by
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_29_1	the perfection of its actuality. It is elemental, it is one element. If we examine snow under the microscope, we find that every crystal has its design, in each a melody is caught and frozen, none repeats another, all are as intricately decorated, as reciprocating as a fugue. None fe. peats another, but all are hexagonal. Sound, like the snow, has its will, and it is the first part of musical invention to discover that will and of musical enjoyment to delight in it. Then upon this first discovery and delight, a second is grafted, proceeding from expression, speech. The patterns of the snow mean everything and nothing. Into the patterns of sound, as the mind reconstitutes them, flow the qualities of the individual in whose mind they are born. They have essential rationality, they have also their personal interpretation of the rational. Mind made them, or what made them made mind— put it as you will. And now in them the mind returns upon itself. The mind that is coming to be communes through music with the mind that is.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_30_0	The passage from derivative to essential form is well illustrated in the fugue, which was vocal in origin and may be said to represent the reaction of music against that restlessness which drives words to forsake one topic for another. “This sweet and merry month of May” —it is a theme for a symphony; but the poet moves on, “when nature wantons in her prime”; so the voices must move with him and start wantoning. Music resents such a subservience; it gives her no opportunity to deploy her powers; she invented the fugue to show how one phrase could link earth with heaven. ‘To enjoy the fugue we must accept its convention. The fugue has its theme as the tree its leaf; and to object that, because the voices answer one another, the construction is predetermined, is as if one should object to waterfalls because the water always falls down. The form of the fugue is imposed by the very nature of sound; the composer’s problem is to use it expressionally. Few succeed, because the material fabric of the fugue demands an expressional power proportioned to its complexity; which few can command, The fugue is concentrated expression, a consensus of melodies, each reinforcing the rest, all advancing and retreating under a common impulse; with every recurrence of the theme, the capacity for expression and the demand for it increase together. ‘The only objection to the form, not exactly a musical one, is that it is too musical, that it keeps
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_30_1	music too much to itself. The virtue of music lies in a reciprocating closeness and aloofness. Standing on its own feet, it measures the world and, its independence once assured, can afford to be accommodating. But the fugue insists on independence, and by its impassioned inter-knitting of ideal emotions carries the spirit away to hypothetical altitudes, with which it may never find any other means of contact.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_31_0	The fugue is objected to by the un-musical because of its monotony of intricacy; another form inherently as musical as the fugue is objected to because of its monotony of simplicity; I mean the air and variations. Variations were at first merely ornamental, but it was soon perceived that the charm of the ornament was its comment upon the air, and in the end the air becomes, ideally, a kind of protoplasmic germ from which a universe of feeling is elicited. Whence we may draw this hint for listeners, that music knows no fixed significances. The same melody, differently delivered, is grave and gay; the phrase which at one moment meant joy, at the next means resignation. Words can only mark these transitions; their rise and fall, their ebb and flow in music have the fluctuating, progresSive insistency of the waves and tides. Modern musical developments tend to favour that muddle of the literary mind which connects accumulating significance with range and change of refer. ence, and substitutes for composition the splicing together of unfinished fragments in joints that will not hold, In the most satisfying forms, identity of idea is obvious and unquestionable, and its enjoyment fundamental and continuous. The man who does not like the variations which Mozart wrote when he was nine years old will never really like music; not that the magic of Mozart is in them, but that they lay the simple primaries side by side, like the colours of the rainbow. What after all
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_31_1	are the most gorgeous pictures but a tempestuous confusion of those translucent bands? and what is music but the elaboration of a sound-spectrum just as clear? The trouble with the set melody is that it is often too highly fashioned, and so determines its decorative treatment, which, to be most musical, must be free. ‘The fugue itself is an air with variations, an air brief that it can be tossed from hand to hand like a ball. The sonata is an organic variation on two reciprocating or complementary melodies which, in certain high-wrought examples, ultimately heard together. All music is variation upon an air.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_32_0	The intensity and concentration of musical feeling compel at times the speculation whether to feel so much and so curiously is not a waste. Feeling is our bond with the universe. Does deep exploration of the shadow-world of sound enlarge our general interpenetration, or do we exhaust our energies on these phantoms? The question is partly moral; we all have our emotional, as we have our financial, resources and can no more spend our feeling than our money twice; but there is no law of adjustment, let every man look to his own affairs. The aesthetic aspect of the case, if less interesting, is more pertinent here. One of the more mysterious facts of history is the callous cruelty of our forefathers. And if, the last century or so, a certain kind & obtuseness has been banished from society, we may be sure that the new sensibility is largely due to the circulation of experience through music, to the quickening of the imagination which music brings. Music keeps our susceptibilities at the high tension normally associated with love, and turns the brief insight of passion into a slow-penetrating, impersonal absorption. Who can doubt that love itself has gained as much in tenderness and abnegation as in radiance and ardour, since Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms shared their raptures with the world? Beethoven claimed for music and its transports an ultimate, a metaphysical message; and, of course, though sound has its idiosyncrasy, it cannot really be separable from anything else. The unity
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_32_1	of the whole is in it, as the life is in every limb. All meaning is implicit in every Movement of perception could we but pierce to it; the quality of the creative breath that made and sustains all is with us now. The revelation music brings is singularly close because it is essentially qualitative. When the great composers unfold the implications of sound, its powers and its affinities, releasing the storm or rebuking it at their will, they have passed the barrier which divides the artist from the prophet—we can use either name indifferently.
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_33_0	The channel of communion was wide at first and the conviction of the sacredness of the art natural and general; but by degrees this dedication was conventionalised till at last music came to be associated even in the popular mind with sickliness, with “uplift.” Secularisation was inevitable. Too long bent, the bow had to be unstrung. Jazz itself is tolerable when we see it to be necessary. It is a revolutionary infection, a bursting of fetters, the mind’. refusal to be shut in with any presuming holiness. But alas! the mind, craving for freedom, can at best but choose its prison and sometimes turns from a sweet cell to a sour one, In any case, the authority of the revelation, as it first came, is unaffected by all our modern ingenuities. The discoveries of Bach, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert show in what kind of world they felt themselves to be moving. Schubert specially convinces, because his nature was so full, his life given so lavishly to the simple pleasures. All he touched turned to music, yet when music possessed him it sustained him in an unearthly trance in which joy and pain are fused together. Schubert’s adventurous mysticism becomes reflective in Brahms, whose work is cloying to many in its conscious application to a task they do not understand. But even religion can be sincere. The musician has reasons of his own for believing that God is love, and it is rash to rebuke him when he gives his life to
2-16-enjoyment-music	doc_2_33_1	the testimony, Of all musical pleasures, making music is the best. Music is a dance of the mind, and, if many are content to sit out, it is because they have not felt the joy of authentic motion. The gramophone and other contrivances of the kind, in increasing our opportunities of hearing authoritative interpretations, must not be allowed to discourage singing and playing, nor lead us to mistake the order of the virtues in music and put technical proficiency too high. Music only lives as : created experience, to be restored to life at each performance, and agile fingers or a flexible throat are no guarantee of understanding. Mastery of an instrument, high virtuosity, command wonder and awe, like the sublime in nature, But only among intimates can we respond intimately. forgetting the intoxications of display and discovering serener certitudes. To the world as we apprehend it our reply is an emotion as the spirit reaches out towards its presentiment of truth. Music freely utters that searching presentiment, and we shall find the most sensitive discernment of the lines it follows among those who feel the world as we do. Nor is the enjoyment of music divided from other joys, though it soars above them. The song of life draws beauty and virtue from the life of which it is the song.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_0_0	THE APOLOGY OF ARTHUR RIMBAUD
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_1_0	To sleep is to accomplish a half-circle, the rest of which is described during the hours of waking. Our essential self—not that part of us which we project outwards for others to see, admire, or dislike—but that which we, in a knowledge shared by none, know as most truly ourself, remains for ever in the centre of a circle that is larger or smaller according to the mental capacity of a single day of our life. This—we will call it, if you please, the soul— stands poised on a horizon, with sleep below and waking life above it. On the days when it has fulfilled but few of the implications of its existence it projects that part of it which others are permitted to experience but a short distance, and then the circle is small; the meridian is reached without effort, without ecstasy, and the descent below the horizon into sleep, down to the nadir and up again to the surface, is as brief and as uneventful. But on the days when we have felt to the utmost extent of our powers, when perhaps we seem to ourselves to have released a new spring of energy within us, then does our soul shoot us out from inside itself like the first beam of the dawning sun; we swing in a wide circle, reaching at length a meridian of unrivalled height and splendour, and when we dip down into sleep the descent is long and slow. The emotional adventures of our
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_1_1	waking life shine down at us through the transparent sea of sleep, and are transmuted for us into new experiences such as waking life cannot provide. The deeper we go into this sea the more profoundly does it transmute the colours of our rainbow that shines down from above it; on these occasions, when we reach the nadir, the wealth is there so great that we long to stay, the better to partake of it. When we are still near the surface our sleep is light, but the deeper we descend the harder it becomes to recall us.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_2_0	On the particular day which is here in question I had risen higher than usual, in consequence of reading that most dense and enigmatic of poems, Arthur Rimbaud’s Sojourn in Hell, risen high and sunk again in the certainty that my sleep would be deep and eventful.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_3_0	Of the scenes, the faces, gestures, and actions that I saw in the first part of the dark ellipse, I remember little. The phrases of Rimbaud’s poem, that are so near to music, carried me on my way. After a time my eyes became sightless, until they should be opened again for what I was to see. I knew that I was moving at a great speed, though I felt no rush of air against my head, and my hands were quiet beside me; it seemed to me that I was the wind itself, rushing down into a waste place, to fill it. In my ears was a booming silence. Then I heard my own voice speaking, though my lips did not move in speech. ‘Slaves! Curse not life!” it said, and, “Eternity is rediscovered.”” I recognised the words as Rimbaud’s, and knew what it was that I should soon see — when my flight should be at an end — when I should have reached the nadir of my sleep. Quite suddenly I was at rest and my eyelids were lifted. I saw before me a fiery arabesque that glowed and flamed against the glittering dark; its shape was that of a wrought-iron gate, white-hot, and tilted slightly sideways. Upon it was stretched the huge body of a man, the muscles and tendons articulated like the long curving leaves of a plant. His hands and feet, of enormous size, were spread out against the corners of the arabesque; these
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_3_1	were turned into whorls round which the fire ran in a ceaseless stream. His face was oval, with high red cheek-bones, and his eyes, which were wide open, held the tarnished light of pools of mercury. His long, dark hair fluttered upwards against the flaming bars like wisps of burnt paper.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_4_0	He opened his wide, shapeless mouth and laughed.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_5_0	“This is the New Crucifixion,” he said.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_6_0	Self. And I am here to find out what you have done to deserve it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_7_0	Rimbaud. You should know. You have read my confession.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_8_0	S., That is not enough. You must admit that you have made it as difficult as possible for one to discover your sins — whatever they were. I have read what you wrote, I have read what others have written about your poems and about your life, and I think I understand. But I cannot know.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_9_0	R. Do you think that you will know, when I have told you — if I do? I might lie to you.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_10_0	S. The dead never lie: it isn’t worth their while.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_11_0	R. Why not?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_12_0	S. Because they presumably do not care what the living think of them.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_13_0	R. That is not true. I do care, and for that reason will not lie to you. I consider my life to have been of the first importance, and am angered by the misinterpretations that since my death have been put upon my words and actions. My brother-in-law
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_14_0	S. I think you might ignore him — if only out of kindness. He was in duty bound to misinterpret you, though I do not question his sincerity. Others — Claudel, for example — are more to blame. The truth, surely, is to be sought in your poems and nowhere else. You used to wish that you had never written them. Do you still wish that?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_15_0	R. No. Up to the moment of my death I was never able to see my life as a whole, because the idea of its coming to an end was so abhorrent to
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_16_0	me. I forced myself to think of what it was going to be, in the future, so that anything like a review of it, taking for granted the end as well as the beginning, was impossible. While the end of any sequence remains unknown, the beginning is more or less unintelligible. Now, however, that I know it all, I see that my poems were as important as anything else.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_17_0	S. More important.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_18_0	R. No, not more. That is the mistake you must correct.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_19_0	S. You must help me to do so. JI think you will admit that it is not surprising that to most people your life seems unconquerably graceless. That, you will say, is not to the point, and there I am prepared to agree with you. But, if you want me to correct mistakes, you must make many things clearer to me than they are at present. Your mother---
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_20_0	When I had spoken these words, one of the flames lengthened and swept over : Rimbaud’s face, hiding it for a moment from my sight. When I saw it again it was charged with memory — revived like a watered flower.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_21_0	R. I hated my mother, but I could never entirely get away from her. I used to make her angry on purpose, so as to harden myself against her and in defence of my life — as one sharpens a knife on a stone. Once, when she refused to let me have a piano to play on, I cut the dining-room table into the shape of one. When I saw her face — so like my own—freezing with anger, I felt myself harden _ inside. She would have been horrified if she had known what she was doing to me — winding me up like a clock, tighter and tighter, so that sooner or later I must fly out and set my life going at a speed as furious as her anger. When I wasn’t at school I used to escape from my mother and sit in a boat moored on the river. I never tried to row it about; I just sat huddled up in it, looking forward to something at once definite and indefinite. There was a row of thin poplars on the opposite bank; the wind seemed to come out of them. They blew hot and cold on my thoughts, making a noise like rain on a window, looking sometimes like a storm of bright silver coins, at others like mere dark, still ! masses. Now, of course, I have made metaphors of them; but in those days — even as early as that—the symbol and the
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_21_1	symbolised were often one in my : mind, and so it was with the poplars.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_22_0	S. Even so, I suppose, poetry had not yet become your first preoccupation. There must, I should have thought, have been a difference in 4 quality between your attitude to experience then — at Charleville — and that which eventually landed you in Paris.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_23_0	R. Of course there was. Life, with a capital L, was then still my object, though a more or less unconscious one. The unfortunate thing was that it could not be preserved as it was; it became fatally diverted, dissipated, and reassembled into poetry. That came about largely through Izambard, though I cannot blame so finely understanding a character as was his. He was much older than I, a master—as you know— in the school. I became even fonder and more admiring of him when I saw how much my mother disapproved of him. It was through him that I came to anticipate my Paris and London existence. I began to write poems.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_24_0	S. I remember. “Long live the garish taverns, full of the cries of drunkards banging tin pots together and often the candlesticks too!” That was your way of looking forward.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_25_0	R. Yes—but to life, not toart. Don’t forget that. One half of Francois Villon was in me already, the other half was to come, then the whole was to pass away from me into Verlaine.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_26_0	S. I don’t think that the parallel between you and Villon is worth making; he was a sentimentalist of the first water — like Verlaine — and you were never that.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_27_0	R. There you are right. But, all the same, there was much of Villon in me at one time — the coarseness, for example. I came to take a delight in all kinds of crudity. Always, throughout my life, I enjoyed schoolboy humour of the grossest sort, and this was the time at which I began to indulge in it. The poems that I wrote were either bitter satires on my mother, or else expatiations on the kind of themes I have just mentioned.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_28_0	S. Some people would say that the Louse-Hunters was one of your finest poems. I’m not sure that I don’t think so myself.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_29_0	R. But that poem belongs to a later period, when I was nearly up to the neck in literature. You anticipate too much.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_30_0	S. I apologise. Please tell me more of the days when you made your first escape from your mother.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_31_0	R. The remembrance of that occasion is disgusting to me. It was the prelude to my first great disillusionment. My love of crudity had led me into a worship of war for its own sake — a lamentable fallacy, which I speedily got rid of, but not until it had come near to breaking me. I was full of republican principles, founded on hatred of my mother’s tyranny, and I longed to let fly in some violent action. My mother and I and my sister were sitting in a field near the river where I used to sit so often alone. I could see the row of poplars from where I sat among the tall grass; they seemed to give me back the vivid thoughts I had when I was alone with them and to urge me to take my chance. I told my mother I was going off on a walk by myself. She said I was not to be away long, as she wanted me at home for something or other. I ran and ran. It was a very hot day.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_32_0	S. You can’t have seen much of the war.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_33_0	R. I saw enough to find it hideous and sordid. It was not life at all, in spite of the noise and movement. There was something horribly artificial about it, like a game in which children lose their tempers.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_34_0	S. Yet I think, perhaps, that if you had not seen the war you would not have written the Illuminations, the Sojourn in Hell — certainly not the Drunken Boat. Life would have succeeded in keeping you away from art.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_35_0	R. It defeated its own object, in showing me war. But the defeat was a little more gradual than you might think. I didn’t give in at once; my passionate desire for the life heroic remained with me for some time after the war had laughed in my face—as I furiously put it to myself at the time. You see, from my earliest childhood I seem to have known exactly what my life would be in its three phases.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_36_0	§. You foretold it correctly.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_37_0	R. In my poems, yes. It is that which strengthens my conviction that my ultimate pursuit of life was right —right in that that was the way in which I should in the deepest sense fulfil myself. For that is the goal, isn’t it? That is morality?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_38_0	§. So it seems tome. But J am not yet convinced that your poems were not the fulfilment. I am not a sceptical man, in an eighteenth century sense, but where the justification of art is called in question, I am naturally up in arms.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_39_0	R. Naturally — but wrongly. You are probably one of those who say: “Oh! how can anyone live without books — without something to take them away from mere humdrum living!” Now that is rubbish. Mere living is not necessarily humdrum, even when it means doing the same thing — and what may seem superficially to be a dull thing — every day. Sometimes the people referred to have discovered the thing for which art is a substitute.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_40_0	S. Do you claim to have found that thing?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_41_0	R. Eventually, yes. But not in 1870. As I have told you—or rather you have told me — the war prevented me from doing so that time. It flung me headfirst into the sea of literature, in which I was never happy. All the time, at the back of my mind (and not always at the back), I knew that what I was doing was not really to the point. At first I nearly deceived myself into believing that it was; but this became increasingly difficult to do, and the more I wrote the less I cared for it all.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_42_0	S. Even at first — in Paris?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_43_0	R. That was the best time. If I remember right, I thought “my life was a banquet where all hearts, all wines, overflowed.” But there, again, those words were really a prophecy rather than a looking-back.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_44_0	S. You were determined to get to Paris; you tried so often. Was that for life or for art?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_45_0	R. For both, I think; though, as it turned out, art was to get the upper hand, once I was there. That was Verlaine’s fault. But at least I got a sensation of freedom, momentary as it was. However often I was dragged back to Charleville I knew that eventtually I should get clean away, for a time at least. I wrote the Drunken Boat and resigned myself to art.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_46_0	S. Did you make no farewell to life?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_47_0	R. Yes. My farewell was a woman — a young girl. I dare say you know the story...
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_48_0	S. It is hinted at, but some have doubted it altogether.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_49_0	R. It is true enough. My friends used to tell me that I did not know what real love was; they told it me for the last time on the night before I went to Alexandria, leaving them all for ever. It wasn’t true, but I didn’t want to have to explain to them how wrong they were.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_50_0	S. Was the girl very much in love with you?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_51_0	R. Yes. She was a simple soul, with no inkling of my character to guide her. I never let her see what I was like. I think that if she had tried, or cared to try, she could have kept me at home; I might have married her later and settled down at Charleville. You may judge from this how much I loved her. But she didn’t know; she was completely dependent on my will, and once she had come to Paris with me her chance was over. I sent her away from me; we had a terrible scene — in the early morning — on one of the boulevards. She begged me to let her stay with me. I did not know what to do: I could not take my eyes from her face, and in it I saw the mirror of the life that I was determined to leave. I loved her, yet in her eyes I could see reflected only the ugly barrenness of the war, as I had seen it. If it had not been for that I might have given in and have let her stay. But because of what I saw, I could not think her love enough; so I sent her away. She walked, dragging her feet and crying in the greyness of the empty street. I put my fingers into my ears so that I should not hear her, and sat down on the bench with my eyes shut. When I opened
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_51_1	them she was gone. After that, though I returned again and again to Chatle. ville, my chain became weaker and weaker, and eventually it broke. I was in Paris — with Verlaine — and had forsaken life.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_52_0	S. But if the war of 1870 disgusted you so deeply, why did you join the army of the Commune ?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_53_0	R. Because some of my revolutionary illusions still remained, I suppose. In any case, you are wrong: I was never a communard; I did not get to Paris in time. So that idea died a natural death. What remained was the Drunken Boat—a strong enough illusion, I think you will allow!
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_54_0	Rimbaud’s mouth widened and relaxed. The bright colour had gone out of his cheeks, sucked away by the fire which burnt more fiercely round his head, throwing out little flames. Throughout the next part of our conversation it burnt so blindingly that I could scarcely distinguish Rimbaud’s face: it seemed to have become a part of the fire, and his voice came to me as if out of the void of darkness beyond.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_55_0	§. And what exactly do you think it was worth — that illusion, as you call it?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_56_0	R. It was worth Verlaine’s first letter to me. And what a letter! I ought to have seen through it even then— seen through poor Verlaine’s love of gush for its own sake. He had to pour himself out over someone, and he soon found that his wife was a poor subject for that sort of thing. But I didn’t see through it all the same. What I thought was: “Here is someone who will not look upon me as my mother does.”
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_57_0	S. And when you got there you found another Charleville—a bourgeois interior, such as you detested.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_58_0	R. Exactly. It was, as you have guessed, just Charleville over again, with Madame Mauté instead of my mother. Of course they all hated me at sight—except Verlaine, who kept on heaping food on to my plate at supper, to show me the welcome they were withholding.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_59_0	S. I think that it was partly your own fault that Madame Verlaine and her mother hated you. If you hadn’t been so surly and ungracious
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_60_0	R. Ungracious! It was never my way to be gracious. If they had accepted me as I was, all would have been well.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_61_0	S. But you must admit that you did not speak a word all through that first evening. I don’t think you could have expected them to stomach that.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_62_0	R. Well, I was tired; if they had looked they could have seen it. Why couldn’t they have left me in peace till the next day? I was ready enough to talk then.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_63_0	S. But not pleasantly. You did nothing but deride them all and sow dissension between Verlaine and his wife.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_64_0	R. That isn’t true. I did nothing of the sort. Verlaine and his wife were in a state of dissension when I arrived. Do you really believe that, if I had never met Verlaine, he and his wife would have remained long together?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_65_0	S. I dare say they would not; but that doesn’t excuse your behaviour, which must have hurried on the breach, however little you actively did to precipitate it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_66_0	R. The sooner they parted the better it would be for Verlaine. I saw that at once. He was a born Bohemian and the Mautés were the pursiest of bourgeois; the whole thing was hopeless from the beginning. It was just like Verlaine ever to have thought that such a ménage could succeed! He considered the whole affair a huge joke, but it disgusted me, and I became more and more sulky. The life was far from what I had expected it to be, and I found it difficult even to write poetry. S. You don’t seem to have found the literary world of Paris any easier than the Mautés to get on with. R. Do you wonder at that? They — I mean Verlaine’s friends — infuriated me. They were always trying to get things out of me — to make me commit myself in conversation. So I would hardly speak at all. I felt that I was up against them, with their literary jargon and good manners. They made me feel like a peasant — which was what, eventually, they wanted to do. Oh! I’ve no doubt I was intolerable; but then, so were they. I used to have scene after scene with Verlaine about it. He said that I was spoiling all his friendships, alienating all his friends. So I told him that he must choose between them and me—romantic that I was in those days! Of course, the moment I said that he stopped scolding me.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_66_1	Sometimes he burst into tears. But always he ended by saying that he loved me more than any of them; that he didn’t care if they all left him, so long as I stayed: that I would stay, wouldn’t I? And he would stare very closely at me with his prominent, fishlike eyes. But I never would promise anything. I knew that if I did he would throw it back at me at some awkward moment, and I didn’t want to be tied, especially to someone for whom I had lost all respect.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_67_0	S. I am surprised that you should ever have felt any, after his first letter to you. ‘‘Come, great and dear soul, we await you, we want you.” Are these the accents in which a respectworthy person would address for the first time someone he had never seen? R. Perhaps not. But I was go anxious to escape from Charleville, as I have emphasised before, that I paid little attention to the manner of Verlaine’s address. It was only after a prolonged course of emotionalism that I realised that I could nor respect him. He gave himself away to me continually; I almost hated him for having so little sense of self-preservation. He was disgustingly pathetic. The last straw was the rumour that our relationship was a sexual one.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_68_0	S. I shouldn’t have thought that you would have cared about your reputation.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_69_0	R. I didn’t. If the story had been true I shouldn’t have cared at all. But the fact that it wasn’t made it gratuitously irritating to me, all on edge as I was. My sexuality was always normal. The story put the cap on my hatred of Verlaine’s friends. ‘They had to think of some way of getting their own back out of me for my insulting behaviour to them. Besides, I dare say they thought that it was true. Judging alone by Verlaine’s manner to me (he seemed pleased rather than vexed by the story!) it ought to have been. But it wasn’t, and I couldn’t stand the strain of such a life any longer.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_70_0	S. Was that why you suddenly decided to go away?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_71_0	R. Of course. I didn’t really care by that time whether Verlaine came with me or not: I was sick of him and of everything connected with him. So I just told him that I was going away, not really believing that he would go to the length of leaving his family to follow me.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_72_0	S. That was stupid of you. If Verlaine loved you as much as you make it clear that he did, then it should have been plain to you that he would go with you, especially with his irresponsible character.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_73_0	R. But his wife was ill. I thought that he would have been moved by that. So I was adamant in my decision to go at once, just to see what he would do. The moment when he agreed to come with me was the first time that I felt any admiration for him.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_74_0	S. Callousness does not seem to me in the least admirable, though I am not surprised that you should find it so.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_75_0	R. It wasn’t callousness. What would have been the good of Verlaine’s sitting maundering at the bedside of a woman he didn’t love — almost, in fact, disliked — and who had ceased to love him?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_76_0	S. Had she?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_77_0	R. She had indeed. I had seen it in her face many a time.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_78_0	B 5. In any case his impulse was purely selfish.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_79_0	R. And rightly so. Everything that was genuine in him, however sentimental and self-deceived he may have been, was connected with me. The Mautés were completely alien to him; he owed it to himself to get away from them.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_80_0	S. And to you? It is possible that he thought he owed it to you.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_81_0	R. It is possible, but it isn’t true. I think that the first impression upon him of my decision must have been very strong. It was my saying, “We are going away,” instead of “I,” that originally made the outcome certain. Anyhow, as you said, his impulse was purely selfish. I wasn’t even artistically a help tohim. He did not understand my later poems, though he professed to admire them. As for his, I hated them though I had not yet taken to saying so. One of the things my Paris life taught me was the kind of poetry I really disliked and despised. Verlaine’s sentimental caterwauling filled me with disgust. I admit that he had metrical ability, but that was all the merit I could ever see. The only things he wrote that I liked at all were those obscene poems; they amused me. I expect that you’ve read them, or some of them; he wrote them by the score.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_82_0	S. I've read Hombres, if that’s what you mean. They didn’t seem to me to have much merit. To tell you the truth, I found them very dull — as dull as pornography always is.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_83_0	R. There I can’t agree with you. I have always enjoyed obscene literature — at any rate in certain moods. Verlaine and I, especially when we were drunk, used often to write indecent poems together, capping each other’s lines. ‘There was one poem, of which I was supposed to have written the alternate verses, and which has since, I believe, been used to prove that I had sexual relations with Verlaine. Oddly enough, this poem is one in which I had no hand; the verses that I am said to have written were parodies, by VerS laine, of what he considered to be my _ poetical style. If you read this poem ES carefully you will see that the verses in question are obviously fakes.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_84_0	S. I had already come to that conclusion. But what about your own poetry?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_85_0	R. It had crystallised. Images had definitely become the reality for me. This was the final effect of literature — the ousting of life by art, which had taken place within me. The free substitution of one symbol for another — the shaping of a world in which each thing could be substituted for anothe; without injuring the meaning, this was my preoccupation. Where other poets, in using metaphor, have included both the comparer and the compared, I came gradually to neglect the latter and to leave only the former. To speak more accurately, the two grew together in my mind.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_86_0	S. And what of the place of music in this scheme?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_87_0	R. The highest place. In the invention of a poetic idiom that would touch all the senses at once, such as I desired to attain, music was at once the stepping-stone and the rock upon which my poetry was to be built.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_88_0	S. In your later poems it seems almost as if you had used some of the common dynamic combinations in music to give the effect of a movement that is, in an entirely peculiar sense, unspatial. It is as though the emotional content of the poem were the constant centre of a circle, the circumference of which was always shifting its position. The Sojourn in Hell is a great crescendo! the movement throughout becomes slower in direct ratio to the increase in dynamic power, until, at the end, the whole seems to open out into a ringing, metallic vacuum, in which a brilliance of light has destroyed the meaning of both sound and movement.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_89_0	R. Beyond that I could not go. My mistake was to have pushed thus far, for such regions of art are necessarily uninhabitable. One arrives there only to die—which is what happened to me. Had I stopped short I might have continued to write poetry to the end of my days, which would then probably have been more than they were. But external forces (among them Verlaine) pushed me on into the airless region until the artist in me died, giving place to that other life which had been asleep in me for so long.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_90_0	S. I like to speculate as to what would have happened if you had both remained in Paris, instead of going to London. You might have “reinvented love,” as you called it, equally well in either city.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_91_0	R. That unhappy phrase! It, too, has been used against me in the crudest fashion. No one seems to have been able to realise that the love I sought could not be approached through sexuality, whether or no the latter were eventually to play a part in it. The love that obsessed my thoughts was coldly calculated, and more concerned with things than with people. My journey to London was necessary — inevitable.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_92_0	S. The London of the seventies must have been a depressing place, especially in the squalid circumstances in which you and Verlaine lived.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_93_0	R. The squalor of our life and its environment came in the end to amuse, rather than to disgust me. It symbolised so effectively the tremulous inequality of our minds, the hopeless inefficiency of our common effort. I was a Don Quixote who soon grew tired of his Sancho Panza, but, like him, I created material hostilities in the fever of my brain. I became more than ever conscious of the shapes of everyday objects. Did my mind figure an unhandseled unit of misery? There it was on the wall of my room, winding from the ceiling in a slither of damp. Did the poem I was writing present some peculiar difficulty: The fog flattened its yellow nose against the bleared window and gazed stupidly at the perplexity within. The very table on which I wrote seemed to thrust proof of my apostasy up to my eyes, Sharp edges, dulled so that I could not see them by the smoky gloom of the winter city, hedged me in from stair, pavement, and house wall. My hands, too, became an agony for me. They did not seem part of me and I feared to see them move. For this reason | kept them in my pockets as much as I could. When I wrote, my attention was distracted from the stream of words by my long, knotted fingers grasping and constraining the pen. Between my hands and my soul it was a battle, and if my soul won, my body revenged
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_93_1	itself at last. The tragedy of all this was not lighted from within.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_94_0	S. The gaslight of those days must have been suitable indeed.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_95_0	R. I shall never forget the horror of those flares. To me they were the essential characteristic of London. In the course of our enormous walks the lighting-up of the staring, hissing gas used to guide us on from point to point — Verlaine and I — luring us like an ignis fatuus into the sordid darkness of the docks—or of Clerkenwell.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_96_0	S$. You wore a top-hat.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_97_0	R. I did. In it I carried always the reflection of the livid gaslight. The lamp of poetry was dying a noisy, brilliant death, of which the symbol, like everything else in those days, was continually thrust before me. The crudeness which I had practised as a child now informed all the outside world. In that glare I encountered the open butcher’s shop, yawning on to the street like a carcase turned inside out; the leering public-house, its misted windows glowing on to the wet pavement. You know that we never resisted that: drunkenness was an escape—not such a very blessed one. It did not conceal from me the horrors that stood just out of my sight, so that by squinting I could but catch the edges of their dark cloaks. I knew the life that I was leading, and the knowledge was very bitter to me; it made me more irritable than ever. But it was Verlaine who revealed me to myself. He wanted to imprison my soul; he wanted to “run” me. It was because he knew that, fundamentally, he could never tame me, that he used to get so angry. If I had given in, then I might never have escaped; it was only by holding back that I succeeded in saving my soul from being swallowed up in the tepid stream of sentimentality that he was always pouring over me. It killed the remains of romanticism in me; after that I only wanted hard fact, the
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_97_1	harder the better,—concrete things; I had done with ideas, with literature.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_98_0	§. Yet the last poem of the Illuminations, though it is called Remnant Sale, does not seem to me a record of artistic bankruptcy. Behind your despair seem to lie new wells full of poetic imagery.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_99_0	R. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was becoming weak under the stress of incessant quarrels. Jlluminations was indeed a significant title—the incandescent glare of gaslight on the ruined chambers of my brain. I was ripe for defeat—yet I won. Against a stronger soul than Verlaine’s I might not have been proof. But he was pathetic, and of all types of character I loathe the pathetic most. He lowered my standard of happiness, seeming actually proud of the sordid life we were leading—and that just because we were leading it together, and he liked to think of us both striking a gesture in the sight of everyone. His helplessness dragged me down inside myself, as it were something wet and clinging. He wanted me to give him spiritual support and to sap my strength in that way. It was his idea that I should restore to him his ancient innocence, as if I had not trouble enough to preserve my own! I hated all that clinging together and spiritual mauling. I wanted to stand alone in myself: that was always my condition of friendship, and Verlaine would not even try to
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_100_0	observe it. S. There is an English couplet — you know English, don’t you?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_101_0	R. Yes.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_102_0	S. You wouldn’t know its author—
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_103_0	Blake. It goes like this:
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_104_0	Till thou dost conquer the distrest, Thou shalt never have peace within thy breast.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_105_0	R. That is good...I tried to conquer him by running away, but he got me back. It was difficult to break with him. I despised myself for going back to him in London, when he was ill and wrote for me to come. But I went all the same. It was foolish in me to have done so, for matters went from bad to worse. I used to annoy him in every way I could think of, in a last effort to stave him off. I would not allow myself one gracious word. There was never a silence between us at that time. If one seemed about to occur I felt the volcano of emotion rising up in him, and knew that if I did not start to gibe it would come pouring out and I should become the slave of a spiritual invalid. The strain of inventing means by which to vex him was intolerable, especially as one way would not serve for many occasions. It was like a disease that must be warded off with stronger and ever stronger medicines, until at last nothing remains but to let it pursue its course. I went with women, and that drove him mad. If only he had realised how little they meant to me! Venal love never held . the smallest attraction for me. Then I mocked at his poems — a thing I had always wanted to do, I told him that they were just like himself, and I
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_105_1	exposed his personality to him at length, treading on all his tenderest spots. I teased him like
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_106_0	S. Like a street arab.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_107_0	R. That’s it: like a street arab. I made schoolboy jokes the order of the day — and of the night, when he woke to me up to rave of his spiritual insolvency. My heart went mad and jerked with skeleton twangs, galvanised by the current of our mutual failure. My soul wove cords from steeple to steeple of the city, from star to star, and on those cords it danced, wearing itself into a merciful death .. .
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_108_0	S. But in the end he had had enough and left you. :
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_109_0	R. If only it had been for ever! But I hadn’t a penny, and when he sent for me to Brussels I had to go, cursing myself all the way. Then, at last, it was the end, and you may be sure that I was thankful.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_110_0	S. I am surprised that he did not lose his head earlier.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_111_0	R. At any rate he lost it altogether then. Perhaps it was as well that he suppressed his hatred (for it had become hatred) for so long, otherwise its outbreak might not have been violent enough to set me free.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_112_0	S. I think that up till that time, probably, he had not allowed himself to give up hope of catching you in his net. Remember, his soul was in a desperate state: he had completely let himself go.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_113_0	R. He seemed to realise all of a sudden that it was futile, that he could never hope to keep me with him. I could see that in his mind his life was crumbling away into a heap of shards and leaving him to face himself. That was too much for him, and he shot at me, partly out of revenge, partly to prevent me from carrying on my life apart from himself.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_114_0	§. Did you guess that he was going to shoot at you?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_115_0	R. The thought crossed my mind, But then I was sure that he would not have the courage.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_116_0	S. That was short-sighted. You might surely have seen that an end had come.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_117_0	R. My first feeling, when he had done it, was of surprise, then of admiration. I looked at his eyes and saw in them an absolute blank—as when one looks in at a dark window and sees an empty room. With the shot had spirted out of him all his hatred of me and contempt of himself. I felt suddenly the odious futility of all I had done pierce my arm with an intolerable pain, . . , And I was sorry for him. I might have given in and stayed, if he had remained in the state of mind which made him fire at me. But of course he broke down at once, and that made me angry. I saw all the old emotions rushing back into his eyes, and I could have shouted my passionate decision to have done with them all. I wasn’t going to let him see that I was sorry for him then; that would have been fatal. He wanted me to shoot him, but I laughed and said that I would not even give him that satisfaction!
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_118_0	S. Yet even then you had not seen the last of him.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_119_0	R. I had seen the last that was really to affect me. The trial was simply nothing: I cannot even remember it. { was too much overjoyed at the thought of escape. I travelled back to Charleville with my wounded hand, the pain was getting better, and I saw in it the symbol of the literary attitude to experience which was leaving me 4so fast, now that I had really got away, Only one thing remained—to make my last will and testament. Back at Charleville once more, I made it in the agony of a final deliverance. You have read it; it is called A Sojourn in Hell. Over it I shed the tears of what seemed to me so many wasted years. For I knew clearly enough what it was that I wanted now. Life had come back to me, and I was in a hurry to embrace it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_120_0	S. Why did you burn your testament?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_121_0	R. Because, the moment I had finished it, the last vestiges of aesthetic emotion fell from me, and the experience that I was eager to make, of the potentialities of living in its purest significance, made such a gesture seem to me the merest folly—a childish toy, unworthy of the man I was to become.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_122_0	S. You should not have done it. The world has a dearth of such fires that smoulder, then suddenly crackle and throw out a shower of sparks that fill the sky with innumerable stars. You owed it—that fire—not so much to the life you had left behind with Verlaine as to the life that you had reconceived; your soul had changed before you began to write it. If it had not done so, should we have heard that new music, that lengthening crescendo, that devastating retardation, and, at last, that ringing, blinding vacuum, that was to be filled by the continent of Africa? For what, really, was the leading clause of your will?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_123_0	R. “Slaves! Curse Not Lire!”
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_124_0	His voice echoed round in the dark cave and the flames died down, softened like undulating chords of music, and Rimbaud’s head appeared again, defined in strong lines against the glare. During the final part of our discourse, his face was so vivid to me that I was forced to consider it like a picture—to reconstruct it consequently for the fulness of its intention.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_125_0	S. I confess that now I am impressed by the almost incredible symmetry of your life—impressed into a conditional acceptance of your own interpretation. For symmetry never fails to strengthen the conviction to which the manner of its assemblage points. A solution of a problem which fits the facts is hard to disprove (though one may be persuaded that it is false), except by the discovery of an equally plausible solution. Such an one, at the moment, I find myself unable to put forward.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_126_0	R. My solution is yet to be exposed. So far, you have only followed me as far as Stuttgart. I hope that you will not leave me in that antipathetic neighbourhood; its memory is further darkened for me by a most unnecessary and farcical scene.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_127_0	S. Farcical, you think? Perhaps, in actual fact, it was so. But here again I condemn your callousness, though it fascinates me.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_128_0	R. I assure you that I was even more justified then than before. Remember the new direction of my resolve, and the strength which I had given to it by writing—and still more by burning— my last will and testament. “I succeeded in stifling every human hope within me. I leapt stealthily, like a wild beast, to strangle every joy.”
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_129_0	S. You certainly leapt to strangle Verlaine. Was he then a joy?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_130_0	R. Hardly. So glad was I of my escape that, when Delahaye told me that Verlaine was clamouring to see me again, I was surprised at myself for feeling so little horror at the thought That showed me how far I had Come in a short time. I felt that [I simply did not care and I told Delahaye go. the idea of Verlaine and all that he represented had ceased to impinge upon my consciousness. But when it came to the meeting, the sight of his sickly grey face nearly made me turn and run away. I had heard all about his conversion to Catholicism — the final resort of his feeble soul — after my support had been removed; and it added the last straw to my contempt. My habit of trying to vex him returning involuntarily, I proceeded to address him only as “Loyola.” But he refused to be annoyed; I suppose his confessor had been lecturing him about “turning the other cheek.” At first he tried to talk to me about poetry, but I cut him short, saying that all that had ceased to have any interest for me. He didn’t seem to take it in at all, and went mumbling on about his latest volume of poems. He was still where I had left him, except for the religion, and that was no kind of progress—only an aggravation of his usual mental dry-rot.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_131_0	S. The thought of your conversation is displeasing, as talk at cross purposes on important subjects invariably is. I am glad that I was not there to hear it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_132_0	R. No one was there to hear it, otherwise I should probably have been arrested for knocking Verlaine down.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_133_0	S. What made you violent?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_134_0	R. His endeavour to convert me to Catholicism. Did you ever hear of such miserable folly? What was the good of talking to me — to me, in the fixity of my purpose, my life set and determined and clamped firmly to this earth — about the Virgin Mary?... At first I only laughed, but he insisted and insisted.The painful thing about the whole conversation, as you have remarked was the hopeless discrepancy between our levels of emotional understanding. I would not go down to his, and he would not come up to mine, so there we were. In the end I became, through extreme boredom, really annoyed and knocked him down. I saw that that would be the only way of getting rid of him. I could not stand the thin, pietistic singing that his voice had become—like a sort of mosquito!
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_135_0	S. After you had knocked him down, did he not try to get up and follow yout R. No. He just lay there. I think he was stunned. Anyhow, I didn’t care, nor did I stay to see what would happen. It really was the end, that time.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_136_0	R. After that your life became in some sort a search. It must have been hard to have to begin again at the beginning — for that was what virtually you ke z had to do. You had sought Paris as a a blind man might seek the centre of a a maze; to lodge yourself in Africa was obviously an even greater struggle.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_137_0	R. I rose to it, however, and became increasingly energetic. The more difficult life became, the more I loved and embraced it, finding delight in victories over small circumstances.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_138_0	S. One of which was your mother.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_139_0	R. She could hardly be described as “small,” but she was, intermittently, Be a circumstance, and one which did its : best to dominate me once more. She was now as furious with me for ceasing to write as she had once been with me : for persisting in doing so. ‘The poor . a woman couldn’t understand what I was . about; I was simply a burden to her, but she could not make up her mind to throw me off. Though as hard as nails, her instincts were fiercely maternal. The word “Africa”? made her fly into a passion.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_140_0	S. I suppose you always had Africa in your mind, as your goal, though you characteristically pursued a number of wide circles on your endless journey towards it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_141_0	R. I had decided upon Africa for these reasons: What I wanted was not any particular country—not Africa more than anywhere else — for its own sake, but a synthetic land, where life could be realised on its intensest plane. I knew that Africa would give me most nearly what I was looking for, so I made it my object to get there.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_142_0	S. Yet your literary imagination never wholly left you. That is my chief point against your theory: even at the climax of your life your letters show the poet — dead, if you will, to poetry, but alive to the quite passive beauty of the spectacles which you witnessed. Art, striving to find a way out, lived again in the grand sequence of your actions.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_143_0	R. Of course I know that I never quite got away from my literary imagination, as you call it. The memory of my poems remained with me, but only as springboards to action. You seem to wish to blur the distinction. I repeat, it was Life that obsessed me now. I confess that when I was a foreman in Cyprus I did not go to Famagusta, as I might easily have done, for fear of arousing “‘literary” feelings, such as I detested and feared.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_144_0	S. So you did fear them?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_145_0	R. I feared them as everyone fears their vices. Instead of those formal images, set down on paper, what I wanted was the living realities which they sought so feebly to imprison. I wanted the sea of the Drunken Boat, the streets and houses and people of Towns, the fields and trees and water of Childhood. It was thus that I aspired to “live beautifully’—to mount on to the top of literature and find there life transfigured by the fact of the ascent.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_146_0	S. That ascent would be the only condition on which I could accept your theory, in its dogmatic finality. Without the fact of art, life can be nothing; after it, perhaps, life might be everything.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_147_0	R. Never, during the ascent, did I experience the ecstasy I was afterwards to feel. I sought to know the very quality of living in itself, as one can only realise the peculiar sound of a word
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_148_0	one habitually uses, by attentively repeating it to oneself, over and over again. Thus Africa was, for a time, “the Place,” and exploration “the Formula.” S. I myself have known the most complicated satisfactions in the varying conditions of travel — though mine has been narrow in comparison with yours ... and I never even thought of joining a circus.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_149_0	R. That was a serious attempt at laughter, which I enjoyed considerably.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_150_0	S. But surely the role of clown is crudely, tiresomely allegorical
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_151_0	R. There are clowns and clowns. ... I should not like to have missed the experience. Anyhow, it had nothing to do with art, and the people I fell in with were most instructive.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_152_0	S. Did you positively enjoy the thought of leaving your friends for ever? It is a feeling which I can understand — a not mean gesture.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_153_0	R. The last time that I saw my old friends was at Roche. They did not realise the implications of my farewell. But I did, and I knew that I should not care if I were never to see them again. The gesture meant little to me, I think. I was happy enough in other ways. For one thing, I was itching to see the last of Europe, I was once more in search of my eternity.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_154_0	S. I am glad, for your sake, that you did not find it in Aden. A more abominable spot---
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_155_0	R. You are being flippant, and flippancy impairs the tone of a conversation like this. Aden was a most important prelude, a corner-stone of my life at that time. It hardened me physically.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_156_0	S. I should not have thought that you needed that.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_157_0	R. One always needs it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_158_0	S. That life may have given you an
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_159_0	illusion of hardness, but it is my opinion that it really laid the foundation of your cancer. That hostile country bore you a grudge for your temerity.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_160_0	R. It was certainly hostile, and I came to hate it, with a deadly hatred that was indistinguishable from love, I wrung my gold from it and trampled its brown baked earth with the treading of my determined agony. I got what I wanted: I attained the tragic life. “We carry our flag into a filthy land, and our dialect smothers the sound of the drum.”
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_161_0	S. There again you prophesied with astounding accuracy.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_162_0	R. “To the hot and thirsty lands — in the service of the wickedest military and industrial exploitations! We bid farewell to wherever we may be. Conscripts of good-will, we will entertain a savage philosophy.” My heart was heavy with a peculiar and intentional joy. That was a climax, for only at the end of supreme effort can joy be successfully intended.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_163_0	S. It was, I suppose, as a thank-offering to that joy that you took an Abyssinian wife.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_164_0	R. Rather was she a part of the joy, She was also the second woman only whom I really loved. You might say, if you wished, that with her I reinvented love. The re-invention was not what I had originally intended, but it sufficed, for there were other and more important things. This she knew, as no European woman would have known, though I never spoke to her of it. Our life together was very tranquil: she was a woman of few words. From her I learnt gentleness, a feeling for which I had never before had a use.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_165_0	S. Ah! I see. For I confess that I was surprised, when I read your letters from Africa, to find how agreeable and — well, tame, you had become.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_166_0	R. It was at last possible for me to be that. Mastery of one’s world is the only permissible condition for agreeableness of demeanour. I had always been a slave — to my mother, to art, to Verlaine’s emotional crises. Now I was a slave no more to anything and could afford to smile. Not that, in point of fact, I ever smiled much, at any time!
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_167_0	S. Did you think much during this climax?
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_168_0	R. Yes, but in a purely practical manner. I gave my mind over to geography and the getting of gain. Hence all those reports which I used to send home to France. I enjoyed writing down bare concrete facts, a pastime I had not indulged in before. The satisfaction which this activity gives is very great—especially if the facts you record have been discovered by yourself.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_169_0	S. The composition was not a literary one; otherwise, I suppose, you would not have undertaken it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_170_0	R. Certainly not. If it had been in any way literary, the satisfaction — akin to some expenditure of purely physical energy, like digging in the earth — would not have accrued.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_171_0	S. Even so, had your mother sent you the surveying instruments which you asked for, instead of locking up the money, I believe that the resulting work would have been remarkable from a literary, as well as from a practical, point of view. Your sense of words and feeling for vivid images would have got the better of you sooner or later, if you had embarked on a book of any length. I regret bitterly the loss of what could not have failed to be a curiously interesting production.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_172_0	R. I like to think that you would have been disappointed. I had too firm a hold upon myself by then to have allowed images to escape me.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_173_0	S. Well, at least I can sympathise with you over the slackening of that hold.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_174_0	R. My only consolation was the comparative suddenness of my failure. A gradual decline would have left me ample time for self-pity, pessimism, and all the feelings that I most abhorred. You must not forget that, compared with the lengths of the other phases of my life, that of my African adventure was quite inordinately long. Because so little is known about it, and because it may seem lacking in the dramas of my earlier life (a fallacy, that), people are apt to telescope this period in their minds into as many months as there actually were years. I had my day, in a fuller sense than perhaps you imagine. But triumph cannot last long, being essentially an ephemeral manifestation of the human spirit’s relation to its environment. I could always reflect upon that, and did so freely. I could feel that I had “had my fling,” as you might say. Arguing with Menelick at Ankober was better than arguing with Verlaine. We wrestled on a basis of fact, instead of on a quicksand of emotion. But I had not anticipated the onset of physical pain; it took me by surprise and completely undermined my vitality. I got tired of life, instead of rejoicing more and more in it; at my lowest ebb I wanted to settle down at Roche and vegetate — with a common-place wife. Even then I felt that my desire to live beautifully was a right desire, greater than any other ambition. But physical health, a
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_174_1	possession that it had never entered into my head to value, simply because I had always had it, is a prerequisite for the kind of life I had moulded, and the two left me together.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_175_0	S. Your retreat from life was worse — more difficult for you than your retreat from art.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_176_0	R. I accustomed myself to regard it as a judgment. It was the earthly form of this crucifixion, which I foresaw just as I had foreseen all the phases of my life.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_177_0	S. If you had not struggled back to Roche, you might have lived.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_178_0	R. I dare say. But I had planned to return there and I had a fixed idea that, if I could force events to turn out as. I had imagined them, the disease would give in and let me live. But by that time pain had transformed all my sequences of thought, melting them down into an amorphous mass of despair. I was, at long last, good for nothing. I did wrong to despise poor Verlaine, for in the end art came back to me in the form of the Catholic religion. My conversion was a visionary metamorphosis of my poems, which in themselves I had long forgotten. Such an abdication was as little distressing to me as possible, so weak had I become. My grip on life failed suddenly, when I got into the hospital, and I only wished to die.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_179_0	$. Perhaps your sister did right . . .
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_180_0	R. Right according to her lights, but not according to mine. She really knew nothing of me; how could she? Yet I am grateful to her. She remained to me as a dream of life, and thus it was that love became for me the sister of death.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_181_0	S. She made you what you must have hated to be — pathetic. She comforted you.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_182_0	R. Oh! I knew that I was pathetic then, but I didn’t care any more. I wanted comfort and I got it.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_183_0	There was a pause in our conversation, — a pause which I felt it my duty, I cannot say why, to fill.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_184_0	S. My opportunities for useful reflection are, I see, coming to an end. The final passages of your life fill me with an intolerable sense of futility, compelling me to regret even the brief triumph you did have. The magnitude of that abdication, too, might not seem so great in the life of another man; but your short life was indubitably equal, in extent of experience and development of soul, to the seventy-five years of the proverbial man; as in the case of the dog, each year of your life was equal to five of that of an ordinary man. So we must reckon nearly five years of physical and mental decay in the record of your life. I do not question the grandeur of the preceding years, but I consider their significance to some extent impaired by your subsequent surrender.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_185_0	R. I cannot blame you now for even so pale a reflection of contempt. Having failed in the eyes of the world to accomplish what in myself I believed that I bad accomplished — if only for a brief period — I can scarcely expect you to alter your opinion of my goal. But still I hold to the perfectibility and the value of it, above all other purposeful actiyities. You yourself belong to the type from which I seceded; your peculiar heaven lies in the true definition of the quality of your imaginative life. May you find it! I wish you well... . But I know that there is a greater thing, and that I came near to possessing it permanently, had my body not failed me at the crisis. For, however great the ecstasy to be enjoyed from the evasion of life that is art, and however great the tranquillity attained by such a synthetic appreciation, it must in the final analysis of value be the fountainhead—life itself —which takes the most important place. If you could triumph over yourself in pleasure and pain, taking freely of both but giving to neither, then life, instead of holding the terrors that drive you into art, would be for you an allsufficient activity. I made this out for myself: that was what I did to deserve this crucifixion. I tried to make my heaven upon earth. I would not wait for the other, that might (or might not) come after
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_185_1	death; I was impatient to understand what I could mean to myself, as all should be; not only such as you, who seek to escape from life by making of it an intellectual abstraction, but those poor creatures who can find nothing better to desire than death. “Slaves! Curse Nor Life!”
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_186_0	S. If what you strove for were to come true, universally, I still think that the world would be the poorer for it. But it can never come true, in the nature of things and of minds, and you must know that.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_187_0	R. I do know it; it was the secret of my tragedy on earth.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_188_0	S. A beautiful tragedy, in itself a sufficient work of art.
2-7-apology-rimbaud	doc_3_189_0	He left me the last word, but I got no satisfaction from it, seeing him crucified on that tangled shape of fire, his face set with the memory of his struggle. He spoke no further word, and then, before I had time to take a last look at his face, the sun of my waking life rose over the sea of sleep.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_0_0	CONTEMPORARY MUSIC
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_1_0	In a discussion of contemporary music one’s choice of treatment is limited practically to two methods. The subject may be considered from a purely national standpoint, which means in result that the musical achievements of each country are in turn examined and estimated. Alternatively, one may disregard almost entirely the limitations imposed by geographical boundaries and simply concentrate upon those developments which, while appearing to be common to “the new music” as a whole, irrespective of country, possess at the same time an importance which is clearly more than temporary. It is to the latter plan that I shall incline in the present essay. The term nationality, as applied to music, has no very precise significance. It is scarcely possible to tell exactly where internationality begins and nationality ends. But apart from all other considerations one does not feel that the clue to the questions here discussed is to be found by an examination conducted upon lines so purely artificial The problems of modern music are in themselves sufficiently complex to make one anxious to avoid any restrictions which tend to obscure the final issue. The “national” view, therefore, must not become more than secondary in the present investigation. That, at least, represents the immediate point of view.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_2_0	The question first to be determined amounts to this. In what respects does the texture, that is to say the essential stuff, of modern music differ from the texture of a classicalist like Bach? That is the kernel of the whole problem, and if the point can be satisfactorily resolved the major difficulties should be at an end.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_3_0	Without preamble, the most obvious difference is that the normal texture of Bach is horizontal whereas that of a composer typically modern, like Schönberg, is vertical. If these terms require explanation let it be said that Bach made real part-writing his primary concern, whereas Schönberg and the majority of modern composers most certainly do not. This change from methods fostered by classical tradition is not, however, solely the product of the twentieth century, but may be regarded as movement from the time of Bach up to the present day. A brief historical sketch may serve to make this clear.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_4_0	An examination of any score of Bach's which may be said fairly to represent that composer shows us that for every voice and every instrument employed, he wrote a part that was in itself completely satisfying. His utterances, in themselves individual, were fused with fine musicianship into a harmonic whole, In concentrating upon horizontal values, Bach wove a texture which was scarcely less satisfactory, even when viewed from a vertical aspect. It is in this markedly coherent blending of two essentials that the finest achievements in music are to be found.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_5_0	With the advent of Haydn and Mozart, however, there came a relaxation of technical discipline so far as texture was concerned. In the music of Bach could be found, for instance, four-part writings in which every part excelled both contrapuntally and harmonically. But after his death the fashion changed. Haydn would write a movement for string quartet in which the only real part was played by the first violin, the others attempting nothing more than an accompaniment to the melody. In fact from one angle the efficient value of the music was equal to about one quarter of Bach’s conception in a similar medium. This clearly marked a degeneracy. Mozart did not forget his counterpoint entirely — the Jupiter Symphony shows that — but it did not occupy, as in the case of Bach, the foremost place. Hence the character of the texture shifted gradually from the horizontal to what was now becoming quite definitely vertical.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_6_0	With Beethoven the process went a step further. For him horizontal values appeared to hold no precise meaning. His music, in character essentially dynamic, by its very nature forbade such an outlook. That he was sufficiently a genius to exploit his method with success cannot be denied. But his example was dangerous in the extreme, as his successors and imitators found to their cost. Hence our present troubles. In the discussion on rhythm this view will be expanded; it will be the endeavour to show to what extent we can trace back to Beethoven, as represented, for instance, in the Fifth Symphony, the origin of those problems of percussive expression which so worry us in the music of to-day. For the moment, so far as questions of texture are concerned, let it be said that Beethoven reversed almost completely the methods of Bach. Vertical writing was, with him, the rule and not the exception. Mozart might be apt to forget his counterpart, but Beethoven scarcely gave it a thought. To that extent had the old order changed. The methods of Bach and Beethoven, direct opposites to one another, formed the principal part of Wagner's inheritance.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_7_0	The music of Wagner seemed, at least, to herald a general return to the best classical tradition, and in that composer himself this promise was certainly fulfilled. He employed the horizontal writing which was so much favoured by Bach, the principal difference being that Wagner’s medium was chiefly chromatic, whereas Bach’s was diatonic. To this he added the best of Beethoven's dynamic method, coupled with his own amazing powers of expression. But men of his genius are rare at all times, and it was only to be expected that those of his contemporaries who attempted to imitate him should fail. Nevertheless, Wagner’s influence was far-reaching both in his own and the present generation. If we take him as a pivot for our discussion of certain developments in contemporary music, it may be possible to obtain a fairly clear idea of the connection between the present and the past.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_8_0	It is here that the argument begins to centre round chromaticism. In the later music of Wagner it was seen for the first time what were the possibilities of chromatic device supported by inspiration of the first order; the earlier explorations of Spohr dwindled into insignificance by comparison, and, even if we allow that in the first instance Wagner was not without certain obligations to that composer, it soon becomes perfectly clear that the influence affected only his earliest works. From late Wagner to early Schönberg is only a step, but if we feel that Verklarte Nacht could have been written by either composer it is equally clear that in Schönberg’s later works, in which tradition is expanded beyond anything known hitherto, the direct influence of Wagner is practically non-existent. At the same time one cannot exaggerate the importance of the fact that it is possible to trace a development from early Spohr to late Schönberg. In this we have an answer at least moderately conlusive to those who would maintain that the new music is entirely unconnected with the old classical values.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_9_0	The development of chromaticism has been as consistent and logical as anything in the history of music, and in our attempt to estimate in what direction the future of music lies we have therefore to emphasise that chromaticism, as a language, has become permanent in character.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_10_0	The movement for what may be termed chromatic economy first became apparent with the advent of Wagner, but it was in his later works that the tendency to condense musical thought became more and more pronounced. It was these methods that first suggested to his successors the possible expediency of eliminating from music everything that was not strictly essential. Bach had written economically, but his was an economy of a different kind. Unlike Wagner, he was not primarily concerned with a chromatic medium. It was with the attempts to develop and at the same time to concentrate chromatic thought that birth was given to the acute questions connected with the new music. We are immediately confronted with problems of tonality. Wagner was not consciously atonal, although at times is came very near to something of th, kind. But those who succeeded him notably Schönberg, knew no such restraint. In their refusal to be fettered by tonality they were, in actual fact, imposing upon themselves the severest limits of expression. It was not long before Bartok was writing music of a character almost diatonic simply as the result of pushing chromaticism to its extremes. The movement became definitely retrograde, while the texture of the music, in spite of its apparent freedom from tonality, was scarcely less confined or less formal than the writings of Palestrina.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_11_0	Nor was this all. The disappearance of tonality was attended by a corresponding vagueness of melodic outline which was sometimes so completely formless as to give the impression that it was altogether lacking. At the best it was remarkably angular; more often the result was apparent incoherence. It is extraordinarily difficult to define what should be the critical attitude towards music of this nature. We are able to analyse to a certain extent the essential stuff of it. We can recognise the absence of tonality and definite melody together with an intense compression of musical thought; it is also clear that the texture is inclined to be vertical rather than horizontal. But after that generalisation is at an end; the point of view becomes individual. To many people the music of Schönberg, for instance, lacks aesthetic conviction. They maintain that its definitely intellectual character debars it from containing anything of real poetry: By ordinary standards of criticism the verdict should be one of condemnation.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_12_0	But from another angle one would urge that since we can trace a tangible connection between Schönberg and the classical values of music, it may be only a matter of further and more detailed study before it is realised more generally that his music contains, admittedly in a form somewhat cryptic, the poetry which to many now seems absent. Ido not suggest that Schönberg is “ahead of his age.” Mr Ernest Newman has shown convincingly enough the foolishness of any such theory. But it may well happen that appreciation is delayed until the close of the composer’s generation. Beethoven’s Symphonies, or some of them at least, were in his lifetime considered as an outrage upon musical convention. Later, Brahms on occasion met with similar treatment. We have classic warnings as to the futility of hasty judgment.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_13_0	In the music of Bartok we find a history of development which illustrates in the most satisfactory sense a growth from “nationalism” to complete individuality. Bartok’s earliest works were built, to all intents and purposes, on Hungarian folk-song. ‘The structure was excellent of its kind, but the derivation was clear. In his later period, like all composers of real worth, he breaks away entirely from this influence. There is nothing of a ‘‘national”’ flavour about his second Violin Sonata, for instance. Bartok’s utterances are couched in an idiom essentially modern, but he has sufficient regard for the forms of music to make his expressions fairly coherent. Closer acquaintance with his work confirms one’s belief that it contains much of real beauty. On occasion his music may be vague and fantastic, but we can hardly charge it with anything worse, and that at least is something to be thankful for. The vertical texture which is such a feature of contemporary writings is there seen at its best.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_14_0	It may be as well to point out that neither Vaughan Williams nor Gustav Holst have succeeded in freeing themselves from the influence of folk-song as Bartok has done. This inclination to borrow folk-tunes and manufacture imitations as a substitute for less derivative thematic material is one of the most dangerous tendencies in modern English music. When one sees the practice followed and encouraged by composers who might reasonably be expected to write music of a character at least moderately individual, there seems some justification for taking rather a severe view with regard to the future musical condition of this country. There is one English composer at least, however, who has contributed something of worth. The reference is to Frederick Delius. His music, as Professor Weissmann has indicated, acts as a mediation between the old order and the new, and the reasons for this opinion are not far to seek. Delius’s writing is chiefly vertical and intensely chromatic, while he has at the same time a gift for non-derivative melodic thought in which he exceeds by far the efforts of most of his contemporaries. In result he has given the world some of its most beautiful music. But his work will not bear imitation; an explanation for this can be found in Mr Heseltine’s comment that Delius comes at the close of the Romantic period, and that any further developments on his particular lines would tend to produce music of an over-ripe quality. This does not prevent him from having
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_14_1	a very particular significance in present and future developments. It is true that he has made occasional use of folk-melody, but his employment of it has always been discreet and sparing, and he never permits its inclusion unless the context ss eminently suitable. Delius is not swayed by fashion. The rhapsodic nature of his art has meant in effect that his utterances have bee addressed to the few. But of the genuine and lasting beauty of his music there can be no doubt. It is, perhaps the most encouraging sign as yet dive played in the present revolution.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_15_0	The results of the Wagnerian movement were far-reaching. A close examination of Debussy’s L’Aprés—Midi d'un Faune shows that its debt to Wagner was considerable, and yet in a general estimate one would hesitate to couple the names of these two composers. In actual fact Debussy soon freed himself from Wagner’s influence, but not until the method of the latter had had a certain effect. It cannot be said with certainty that Debussy was any the worse for the experience, but whatever there is of chromaticism in his music is implied rather than directly stated. Ina yet finer degree the same applies to Ravel. These two composers have, in their mature achievements, contributed works, the nature of whose beauty is quite unlike anything before their day. Critics have been at pains to expose the limitations of the whole-tone scale and are inclined to impose upon Debussy the responsibility for its creation and its faults, but while one has to acknowledge that the possibilities of this particular mode are very few it must also be admitted that on the whole Debussy handled it with credit, whereas his disciples, using it in a foreign context, have failed ludicrously. There is a general tendency to forget the fact that Debussy did not write all his works or any great part of them in the whole-tone scale. One imagines that in future years, after this mode has been allowed to rest for a while, it will take its lawful and not too prominent position in
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_15_1	the musical scheme, and no doubt composers will realise eventually that while it has its limitations it has also its uses if em, ployed sparingly and discreetly, Strauss and Elgar both hold a very definite place in the music of to-day but since each of these composers hag himself worked to its complete fulfilment, the basic idea upon which his mature work is constructed, their actual compositions do not concern us so closely as does the significance of their contribution to musical experience. Strauss showed us the brilliance of which he was capable in the symphonic poems, but he showed us also his limitations. His career has been, from a musical standpoint, in some respects amazing. Tod und Verklarung, Till Eulenspiegel, and Also Sprach Zarathustra indicated in the plainest fashion the excellent account to which the Wagnerian tradition could be turned. But it was impossible for Strauss to subsist for long on the resources of another, and the end, when it came, came quickly. The sequence of symphonic poems concluded as abruptly as it had begun. It seemed, for the moment, that Strauss had nothing more to say. Elektra and Der Rosenkavalier were probably the most interesting products of his next outbreak, but they scarcely left the composer, musically, in a better position than had the symphonic poems. It was due largely to his flair for orchestration that he escaped any serious charge of dullness. But the present generation owes him a debt, quite apart from any value that his
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_15_2	works may have, in that by his example he exposed fully the limitations of post-Wagnerian development in at least one direction. Contemporary composers have the benefit of his experience, and on those grounds alone we must consider his explorations as being justified even though on occasion they proved unsuccessful.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_16_0	Elgar’s importance in the present discussion lies in quite another direction to that of Strauss. His original sources were undeniably Brahms and César; Franck, but he had sufficient individuality to shake off their influence at a fairly early stage in his career. So far as his connection with these two composers is concerned, its significance lies in the fact that Elgar showed more clearly than anyone to what extent the pre-Wagnerian tradition was capable of expansion. For posterity it should be enough that he exhausted the resources in that direction, thereby giving us the fruit of a very helpful experience. His mature achievements do not affect, and are not affected by, the new music. It is difficult to recall another composer of Elgar’s position so completely remote from contemporary movements. If Delius does not follow the fashions of the day, at least his influence is considerable. But to the younger generation of composers Elgar, as an example, means little. One cannot insist that this in unfortunate, since an imitation of mannerisms is not to be desired at any time. Nevertheless, Elgar does not lead others: his is a purely individual art. This may be regarded as a welcome sign so far as it indicates that the best of his music has sufficient character to survive isolation. ‘The same is true of any composer who has the slightest claim to greatness.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_17_0	It is a far cry from Elgar to Scriabin, but if we keep Wagner as our pivot the connection of ideas should not prove very obscure. In an earlier paragraph we observed that the first works of Wagner derived to some extent from Spohr. The idiom of Scriabin is, in its essence, not unlike a blend of these two composers. Harmonically, the common ground is fairly extensive. The later developments of both Scriabin and Wagner could scarcely be more unlike one another, but in the matter of origin there is agreement within a certain range. The exact position of Scriabin in contemporary music has ever been the subject of acute controversy, but in the present essay we can hardly allow ourselves to evade the question on the score of its difficulty. It will be the endeavour to approach the matter without prejudice.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_18_0	Scriabin has suffered as much from his friends as from his enemies. Those who would urge his claims upon us have done so with an impatience which to some extent defeats itself. His antagonists have shown little discretion in their choice of weapons. For them Scriabin is a charlatan and nothing more. But when the mass of literature connected with him is cleared away we begin to get somewhere near the truth. If he is to be judged in accordance with the normal standards of criticism we must be prepared to consider his music
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_19_0	as entirely divorced from any philosophical programme which the composer may have attached to it. We do not need to depend upon the story of Till Eulenspiegel in order to understand Strauss’s symphonic poem. With or without the programme it is an excellent piece of writing. The same must apply to Scriabin. Then, and then only, do we gain any clear perspective of his work as a whole.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_20_0	The composer himself is much to blame for the more gross misunderstandings to which he has been subjected. His insistence upon the socalled philosophical aspects of his work has done him more irarm than good. Stripped of its philosophy and its fables the music is easier to estimate. We can then see the Divine Poem as a cumbersome but promising structure. The Poem of Ecstasy we either like or loathe. Certainly Scriabin’s faults as an orchestral writer are clear enough. His lack of real colour or rhythmic sense, his rigid adherence to form, his occasional hysteria — all these are too obvious a require discussion. But in spite of these manifold disadvantages there is a cohesion and a conviction about the work as a whole which enables it to stand despite an acknowledged handicap. One feels the same with regard to Prometheus, except that the general conception is clearer, more vivid, and incidentally more effective. The colour scheme need not concern us. It is not essential to the performance of the work and distracts rather than unifies. If the Poem of Ecstasy and Prometheus are not better than the more mature of , Strauss’s symphonic poems they are certainly no worse, and there we must be content to leave them.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_21_0	The Ten Piano Sonatas, viewed collectively, are excellent literature. In the first place they are written by a composer with a very real knowledge of the instrument for which they are designed. They are also more forceful and more controlled than the orchestral achievements. If they do not rank with the very highest piano works, they may be properly placed alongside the writings of Debussy.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_22_0	Scriabin has been unfortunate in his biographers so far as England is. concerned. It seems that there are only two English volumes which pretend to deal with him at any length. Both are mediocre: the one, an hysterical and unbalanced effusion; the other, an inadequate sketch. Mr Gray’s essay on Scriabin in his volume on contemporary music is intended to be damning, but as a piece of criticism one can hardly be expected to take it seriously. We have yet to see a detached estimate of the composer’s life and work.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_23_0	It may be asked quite fairly whether the new music is distinguished by any characteristics other than those to which reference has already been made. In this connection it is permissibe perhaps, to point to one device which, in the music of our time has been exaggerated above all others, namely a use to excess of intricate rhythm. It is not to be denied that rhythm has legitimate and important function to fulfil as part of a composer’s technical equipment. But when we find works which, like “Mars” from Holst’s Planets, depend for their ultimate effect upon rhythm alone, one is tempted to question whether this means has not assumed a significance altogether disproportionate to its value as a vehicle of musical expression.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_24_0	It was Beethoven who set the present fashion in dynamics. The opening of his Fifth Symphony shows the crude material from which modern developments have sprung. Tschaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony is an exact parallel to it and is consciously built upon the same model. We have seen in our own time a subtler handling of the method in Honegger's Pacific No. 231. But the composer upon whom it is necesssary chiefly to concentrate in connection with modern rhythmic achievements is Igor Stravinsky. Even if Stravinsky had written nothing after The Rite of Spring there would be ample justification for acclaiming him as a composer whose influence on the music of our age has been remarkable. His technical capabilities are beyond dispute; his powers of orchestration phenomenal. Yet historians are to be found who question his position as a composer of permanent worth. This may be due to the fact that Stravinsky has written a certain amount of music which is frankly experimental - for instance, the Three Pieces for String Quartet. But work of this kind should not be allowed to prejudice our estimation of the composer’s more significant achievements. Beethoven and Wagner both had their less successful moments and it is scarcely possible that a lesser genius can escape if these two did not go unscathed. It must be recognised, too, that for progress experiment is essential. There is little doubt that the somewhat speculative works of Stravinsky have served their purpose in enabling him to see his way more
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_24_1	clearly in his subsequent endeavours. It has become the custom to refer to Stravinsky’s early ballet, The Fire-Bird, as though it is to all intents and purposes the product of the composer’s master, Rimsky-Korsakov. Actually it is very far from being anything of the kind. A fairly close acquaintance with the work makes clear that it has characteristics quite different from any that Rimsky-Korsakov’s music displays. There are certain factors in common, no doubt, but they can hardly be accounted as important. In point of rhythmic effect alone Stravinsky far outshines his master. Even in this early work he shows signs of a remarkable inventive power. Had he relied solely upon technical brilliance his music would scarcely have survived the year of its birth. His second ballet, Petrouchka, supplies still more abundant evidence as to his capacity to think for himself. The work is essentially individual and, rhythmically, extremely ingenious. In connection with Stravinsky it may be well to point out that he escapes to a considerable extent the charge of employing a wearisome metre disguised as rhythm. ‘This latter weakness is the besetting sin of those of the modern dynamic school who have yet to learn what rhythm really means. A favourite device is to alter the time signature with remarkable and unnecessary frequency with the result that a monotonous metre is set up, entirely devoid of any genuine vitality. Stravinsky himself is occasionally at fault in this respect in Petrouchka and The Rite of Spring, but the lapses
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_24_2	are not due, as as in many cases, to sheer ignorance. By skilful use of accents he frees himself to a great extent from metrical encumbrances; the only pity is that on occasion he fetters himself more rigidly thay any classicalist in his endeavours to obtain further liberty of expression.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_25_0	At present it is too early to speak with any certainty as to the ultimate value of Stravinsky’s experiments with what amounts to a modern Bach idiom. A recent performance of the Piano Concerto left one with the impression that a certain refinement would be necessary before the composer could express himself with that clarity which the new style so urgently requires. At the same time one must admit that in suitable contexts the hard, dry brightness of this music is extremely effective. It is illustrated to great advantage in the “Rondoletto” from the Serenade for piano. In that work we see a good horizontal texture together with a remarkably effective rhythmic scheme. The combination of these essentials, if successful in other respects, should play an important part in the ultimate coalescence of the best that is in the old and new methods.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_26_0	The reason why Stravinsky succeeds and Holst fails as an exponent of rhythm is that Stravinsky has sufficient inventive genius to make rhythm his servant and not his master while Holst apparently lacks this essential quality. The whole vexed question hinges upon this point. Rhythm for rhythm’s sake is worse than valueless; it is a curse. On the other hand a composer of originality can find it a very useful asset. In contemporary music it has been greatly exaggerated by numbers of musicians who have mastered little more than its worst cliches. Progress will scarcely be possible until it is realised more generally that the indiscriminate rhythmic devices serves not to stimulate but to kill the character of music.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_27_0	Arthur Honegger, to whom we made reference in an earlier paragraph, is of the few composers who seem to realise the necessity for musical coalescence both in style and form. Like Stravinsky he has succeeded admirably in making rhythm subordinate to his creative impulse with the result that his mature work 18 extraordinarily vital, His symphonic psalm, King David, is one of the most significant of modern choral achievements: By its very nature it opens up vast possibilities in connection with vocal writing, and if the composer’s present method is ultimately successful, the influence upon the choral music of the future should be considerable. King David has a number of characteristics which call for attention. In the first place, that part of the narrative which is normally taken as recitative is spoken, not sung. It is urged by some critics that this serves only to interrupt the sequence of the work, but one feels that as normal recitative does this in any case the situation is not seriously aggravated. Incidentally, as the oratorio proceeds, the proportion of vocal writing increases markedly, so that the narrator does not really come into prominence except for the first part of the work. But the principal importance of King David asa contribution to contemporary music is that Honegger fuses vertical and horizontal writing with remarkable effect, not hesitating to employ either medium, separately or according to the suitability for his purpose at the moment. The final chorus in Part III is an excellent example
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_27_1	of this type of treatment.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_28_0	It was not the fortune of the present writer to see a single piece of criticism favourable to King David when it received its first performance in England early in 1927: No doubt the peculiar coustics of the Albert Hall destroy much of the detail, but, even so, it was hard to gain a fairly clear idea of the composer's conception. The work had great success in Paris, and perhaps acquaintance with it will result in a further extended appreciation of its merits.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_29_0	By way of conclusion to our discussion on rhythm it may not be out of place briefly to consider the relative positions of what are known respectively as “classical” and jazz music. In recent years the problem has been discussed over and over again, though appreciable result. The principal reason for raising the question in the present context is that it seems desirable to indicate, as far as one can, the manner in which the difficulty should be approached if there is to be any real understanding of the matter.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_30_0	Up to the present the issue has been unnecessarily obscured by critics who have expended a great deal of energy in trying to find a basis for reconciliation between classical and jazz music. All such attempts have been and must be, inevitably, quite useless. Until it is realised that each is an entirely separate branch of the same art any efforts to obtain a clear perspective of the question must be in vain. We have to recognise that there is plenty of room in the world for both kinds of music; the trouble starts when one attempts to invade the domain of the other. Further, it must be realised that a predilection for classical music does not debar one from deriving pleasure from dance music of the best type. One of the most irritating arguments that a musician has constantly to face is that he cannot with sincerity entertain both points of view. It is true that the upholders of each cause have frequently made tactical errors. The supporters of jazz music have attempted to justify mutilations and distortions of classical tunes for dance purposes, but the principle is inexcusable. Composers of the best kinds of dance music have shown us that they possess sufficient inventive ability without having to resort to such practices. They have also a fairly adequate technique of their own. In their own province they fulfil their task admirably, It is in their excursions into departments foreign to their art that they come so hopelessly to
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_30_1	grief.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_31_0	But if they have erred, the exponents of classicalism have judged no less inaccurately. They have continually derided jazz music on the score that it falls far below the level of classical works. They seem unable to realise that dance music can be compared only with other works of the same type just as classics must be measured by classics. This confusion of standards has been the cause of half the totally unnecessary disputes that have raged round the present problem. It is to be hoped that presently the question will receive a more impartial treatment at the hands of the critics, but for the moment the outlook is not promising.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_32_0	With regard to the contemporary revolution, it may be said that jazz music will at least preserve the best and the worst of the dynamic system. One must admit, however, that the developments of even the last five years have shown to what extent purely dynamic dance music is limited. There are signs now of a return to coherent melody, though it must be confessed that the restraint which should accompany it is still absent.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_33_0	And this brings us to a point at which it is necessary to summarise our total findings in the present investigation. It has not been possible, nor is it desirable, to dwell upon every aspect of contemporary music. Our business has been to emphasise those achievements which appear to be more than temporary in their significance. It remains to indicate to what extent he are likely to affect the future. The question of texture is, perhaps, the most pressing. Schönberg and Delius may be said to be typical of the present movement, and both employ a texture which in its formal characteristics is undeniably vertical. Of the two, Delius appears to be the more successful. But if he does not falter, a dozen others who use the same method fail to survive the test. The system is dangerous, and success is given only to a few. One would suggest that the foremost reaction against the present fashions will be that horizontal writing will once again come into its own. This step seems both necessary and inevitable. We cannot subsist for any length of time on the crude blocks of sound which so much of the new music offers us. Intelligence is revolted by it. From another angle its texture supplies one melodic interest instead of four or fve. Common sense demands a change from the present starvation diet, and there are signs that this change is slowly but surely coming to pass.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_34_0	An indication that justifies this assertion to a marked extent is the gradual re-birth of the chamber orchestra. It is being realised that a vast and unwieldy combination of instruments is not always expedient. On financial grounds, too, the full orchestra as seen to-day is difficult to maintain. It may be that in the future we shall revert more and more to the ideals of Bach in this respect. But such a process, if it comes about, must mature gradually. As far as music is concerned, the tendency of the present age is to extravagance. We have the folk-song and Elizabethan revivals; there is the Dolmetsch Festival at Haslemere. These developments are too good, or too bad to last. Their supporters are apt to show lack of discernment and moderation. A readjustment of orchestral ideals would require careful though; and a restraining hand. Granted that there are hopes of a reversion to musical prosperity.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_35_0	The return to a horizontal texture would bring with it a saner conception of melody. It is true that we have never been without melody in one form or another, but there is a very clear difference between the melodic product of horizontal and vertical writing. With a vertical texture the melody may become an accident; with Bach there were no accidents of that nature.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_36_0	One feels that the more barbaric music of recent times, as seen in the cruder utterances of the modern dynamic school of thought, must eventually suffer a decline. No one with any pretence to sanity can continue to beat a drum for ever, and assuredly the drums have been beaten enough within the last decade or so, Beethoven, at least, did not supplement his string quartets with percussion. Yet in our own time we have seen endeavours not far from this extremity. Musical sense is still at a premium.
2-10-contemporary-music	doc_4_37_0	On the other hand there have been developments in the new music which, as we have tried to show, may well take a permanent place among the classics. It is to these that we must turn should the outlook seem unduly discouraging. Whether or no one takes a gloomy view of the efforts of one’s contemporaries matters little to posterity. It is according to the judgment of our successors that the music of the present time will stand or fall. Let us hope that they will at least approach with discrimination the more significant achievements of our age.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_0_0	THE REVIVAL OF AESTHETICS
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_1_0	My reader is probably familiar with an institution called an egg-and-spoon race. If so, he will be acquainted with the superior effectiveness of meticulous over spectacular methods.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_2_0	My present undertaking I regard as my own turn in some relay-race of that sort.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_3_0	Mathematicians and Physicists have, as the result of cautious and well-calculated endeavour, forged far ahead in the race and already vanished beyond the ken of the ordinary layman.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_4_0	My own egg I find lying somewhere not far off from the starting-point, spilled first in this direction and then in that by the all-too-ample gestures of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has only been replaced anywhere near its own track by my immediate predecessors. What then more natural than that my efforts to advance it a few feet should be characterised by the ungainly attitudes of extreme circumspection ?
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_5_0	Moreover, the Truth, as Wilde wrote, “‘is rarely pure and never simple.” The first phrase merely dates the dictum, but the second remains, I fear, permanently valid. I shall therefore make no further apology either for pedestrian progress or for the introduction of complicated conceptions into a subject which I regard as having hitherto suffered much from over-confident and oversimplified treatment.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_6_0	First, we must make a preliminary survey of our subject.The single word “ Art” denotes a whole sequence of events. In the first place, something happens in the artist’s mind which causes him to create (a second stage) certain material productions—sounds, shapes, or linguistic symbols, for example—which in their turn have the power of reacting in a particular way upon the minds of other people.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_7_0	We may tabulate the sequence thus :—
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_8_0	FIRST STAGE.: EVENTS IN MIND OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHICH IMPEL HIM TO CREATE |
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_9_0	SECOND STAGE.: CERTAIN MATERIAL PRODUCTIONS WHICH EVOKE
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_10_0	THIRD STAGE.: AESTHETIC PLEASURE IN THE MINDS OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_11_0	To begin then at the first stage, What do we know about the mental events preceding artistic creation ? Common sense tells us that the artist’s activity is a means of “expressing his emotions.” So here we have one answer. Common sense would suggest “ emotions ” as the content of the first stage. Such an answer has, however, the following deficiencies :—
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_12_0	(a) All emotions in all people clearly do not lead to art, therefore we must have omitted some crucial factor.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_13_0	(b) Much of the content of art falls outside any possible definition of emotion. Pictures contain images of “things,” and linguistic art contains “ thoughts.” It is only reasonable to assume that these images and thoughts pre-existed, in the mind of the artist, his material production.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_14_0	Accordingly the first stage of the aesthetic experience, when illuminated by the light of common sense, provokingly reveals enough complexity to baffle simple summarisation, but withholds any glimpse of that fundamental force which manipulates these miscellaneous ingredients, the active aesthetic faculty.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_15_0	Attempts have of course been made to explain away in a sophisticated manner the apparent complexity of what we may call art’s mental raw material. Croce provides the most plausible instance. Following Bergson, he divides mental processes into two categories—the intuitive (or pre-conceptual) and the conceptual. Art, according to him, is the method of expression appropriate to the intuitive processes. It would be quite outside the scope of this essay to embark upon a detailed criticism of Croce’s theory. The extreme vagueness of his psychological conceptions excludes the possibility of definite proof or disproof.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_16_0	I will therefore go no farther than to point out that the present trend of psychological research fails to confirm his basic antithesis of conceptual and non-conceptual processes. In fact, the “‘ Gestalt” psychologists are concerned specifically to contradict some of the assumptions which it involves — the conception, for example, that unsophisticated vision is a sort of photographic image of chaotic complexity from which the intellect extracts order. They maintain that without “ configuration ” (i.e. orderly form of some sort) sensation simply cannot exist.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_17_0	It is, however, as I have said, impossible in this essay to follow out such lines of thought. I must state dogmatically that Croce comes into conflict with the whole trend of present-day psychology.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_18_0	What then, it will naturally be asked, have the scientists got to offer us in lieu of intuition as the type of mental event expressed by art ? Or must we resign ourselves to the conclusion that art may express any and every type of mental event, so that its specific nature resides solely in the way in which it expresses things, and not at all in the nature of the things expressed ?
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_19_0	To such questions I suggest the following answer : That there is indeed a type of mental event which predominantly forms the raw material of art, and that the nature of this type may be best understood by considering an antithesis which has recently received much attention from the psycho-analytic school, the antithesis between the subjective and objective elements of consciousness.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_20_0	Even the most cursory introspection will demonstrate to anyone that his mental impressions may be divided into a procession, so to speak, and a background. The procession is composed of more or less clear-cut thoughts and perceptions, the background is composed of a blurred patterning, which we may call general emotional condition. In fact the tendency of naive introspection is, we are now assured by psychologists, to overestimate the difference between emotion and those more clear-cut elements which they term “ cognition.” Emotion seems to be regarded as a survival of some earlier, less explicit, form of awareness, a sort of lower level of sensation and imagery to which all impressions sink which are too vague to be classed as cognitive.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_21_0	Now it is to this amorphous type of awareness that the term subjective may be most confidently applied, for we think of our emotions as a very intrinsic, or, as one may say, “central,” part of ourselves, while we regard our cognitions as the reflection, in the mental mirror, of external (or “‘ objective ”) Reality.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_22_0	I shall be concerned to maintain that this most subjective stratum of mind is the one predominantly expressed by art, and that the element of art which expresses it is that which modern aestheticians refer to as “ significant,” “pure,” or “ abstract ” Form.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_23_0	This line of argument, however, we must not, for the moment, follow up. We have already admitted our liability to deal with the cognitive items which appear in art.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_24_0	The question, therefore, which next arises is: Can we include these items within any single distinctive category ?
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_25_0	Again I think the antithesis between subjectivity and objectivity will furnish us with a clue.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_26_0	We are dealing, let us recall, with the things represented in pictures regarded as “ real things,” not as mere shapes, and with the thoughts of literature regarded as thoughts, not as mere sound. Music and non-representational plastic art, if such really exists, have dropped out of the question.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_27_0	Now I suggest that we can establish an antithesis between things-and-thoughts arranged subjectively and the same ingredients arranged objectively. To arrange them objectively seems to me to be the scope of science, understood in such a wide sense as to include all practical activity.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_28_0	Art, on the other hand, is a particular (and very rare) variety of the numerous sorts of phenomenon in which things-and-thoughts are subjectively arranged. These other sorts include dreaming, hallucination, fancy, and so forth.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_29_0	I will illustrate my point with an example. Suppose a man to be keeping a diary of his children’s development for his own amusement, he would doubtless put down only that which appealed to some aspect or other of his parental pride, and might even let his imagination, spurred by the same force, run away with him. His selection, that is to say, would be subjective. And out of such diaries perhaps one in a million would be a work of art.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_30_0	Now oppose to these instances the case of a man attempting to keep a scientific record of his child’s development as a piece of psychological research.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_31_0	His own feelings immediately become irrelevant. He must record the humiliating as well as the creditable, the dull as well as the amusing. His outlines must follow the outlines of hard fact. That is to say, his attitude must be purely objective. To call the statistical tables thus accumulated potential works of art is to pervert language.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_32_0	Or again, oppose the case of the painter who puts things in and leaves things out just as he wishes, or even groups together a purely imaginary collection of them, to that of the map-maker, whose minutest line must conform to the pattern of “actual fact.” Clearly the former must be classed with the fanciful diarist, the latter with the scientific observer.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_33_0	Accordingly, I think we may accept the conclusion that art is predominantly an expression of subjective mental elements, and science predominantly an expression of objective ones.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_34_0	Art tells us principally about the Universe viewed from one particular standpoint—the Universe in which bags grow heavier the longer one carries them, and the moon may be bigger than the sun. Science seeks to standardise by eliminating all causes of distortion and establishing a system of “ real” weights and “ real ” sizes.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_35_0	These generalisation are, however, far from absolute. To a certain extent the arrangement of things and thoughts in art is tied to objective reality. It will be one of our tasks later on to discuss the exact extent of this tie. Moreover, though this does not really concern our problem, no doubt all science humanly conceivable is mingled with a certain alloy of subjectivity, a fact of which scientists themselves grow continuously more aware.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_36_0	At any rate, we are now in a position to summarise the first stage of art as follows : That it consists primarily of the emotional background of consciousness, and secondarily of certain cognitive items— “ images of things-and-thoughts,” as we may colloquially call them—arranged in a particular manner, which we have agreed to call “ subjective” ; a manner, that is to say, dictated more by the proclivities of the individual than by a regard for the fundamental structure of the universe, impersonally interpreted.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_37_0	Further, I shall attempt to show that there is a certain correlation primarily between Emotion and Form, and secondarily between Cognition, subjectively arranged, and Content, in art.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_38_0	Once again it may be of assistance to represent our conceptions schematically :
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_39_0	MENTAL EVENTS. THEIR EXPRESSION.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_40_0	COGNITION OBJECTIVELY ARRANGED. SCIENCE.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_41_0	COGNITION SUBJECTIVELY ARRANGED, SUBJECT-MATTER IN
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_42_0	EMOTION. SIGNIFICANT FORM IN ART
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_43_0	It may, perhaps, be as well to recall at this point that our analysis of the mental events preceding the creation of art is still incomplete in one exceedingly important respect, for we have made no definite suggestion as to the nature of the active aesthetic faculty which distinguishes artists from other men.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_44_0	Such a suggestion will emerge when we turn, as we must now do, from the consideration of that which works of art express to the consideration of how they express it — from the raw material to the mechanism.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_45_0	With regard to the mechanism of expression I shall assume, as is usually done, that it displays a polarity between the natural and the conventional, and I shail attempt to show that natural expression predominantly deals with subjective material and conventional expression with objective material, and that art is a special instance —the most elaborate known form—of natural expression, while science is the apotheosis of conventional expression. Conventional expression is not difficult to analyse. Ratiocination naturally comprehends its own products. The device of symbolism by prearrangement seems sufficiently self-explanatory, whether it is a question of semaphore signals, algebraic formulz, or scientific terminology in general.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_46_0	But no such atmosphere of certainty surrounds natural expression. Until quite recently few attempts have been made to enlarge or improve upon the hints thrown out by Darwin, who, naturally enough, regarded only that aspect of it which seemed immediately relevant to his evolutionary theories. His preoccupation with regard to every function he examined was: ‘“ Would this be useful in dodging or downing enemies?” and he succeeded in attributing a vestigiary usefulness of this sort to many reactions which had always been classified as expressive.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_47_0	Lips are retracted in anger as a vestige of our primitive use of teeth as weapons, hair stands on end in order to terrify an opponent by adding to apparent stature, and so forth. All this may be true enough, but it in no way excludes the hypothesis of the Gestalt psychologists who assume that expressions of emotion in some subtle sense resemble the “‘ configuration ” of the emotion expressed, a conception with which I am in sympathy and to which I shall recur. In fact, Darwin’s hypothesis really only amounted to suggesting that much which had previously been classed as expression ought logically to have been classed as practical reaction of a superseded type.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_48_0	The basis of my own hypothesis will be that a resemblance between the mental event expressed and the outward vehicle of expression is the fundamental principle of natural expression.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_49_0	I shall therefore be concerned to argue, in the first instance, that it is possible for the material facts which we have called “ significant form” to resemble the mental facts which we have called “ emotion,” for we postulated emotion as the primary component of the mental stuff which works of art express.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_50_0	I hope that I in no way underrate the paradoxical air which such a proposition presents.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_51_0	It leaps the gulf between mind and matter with a suspicious agility. It has, however, a certain amount of scientific support.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_52_0	When it first occurred to me, some two or three years ago, as the sole possible key to the principal. problem of aesthetics, I was quite unaware how much scientific support it already had.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_53_0	Since then I have become acquainted with the theories of the Gestalt psychologists, and cannot help being struck by the fact that their researches into the basis of mental functioning, founded upon a considerable mass of practical observation, have led them even further in the same direction than I should dare to follow.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_54_0	Here, for instance, is a fair example of their tenets, from Koffka’s Growth of Mind. ‘The inverted commas denote that he, in his turn, is quoting Kohler.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_55_0	““If we were to represent behaviour graphically by means of a time-curve, the behaviour of fright might show an abrupt rise in the curve, followed by a gradual fall. ‘The dynamics of the phenomenal or mental processes accompanying this behaviour would then be indicated by a curve of essentially the same character—and so would a purely electro-motor process in a photo-electric element when it is suddenly and briefly exposed to the light.” Now let us assume that the terms “ abrupt rise”? and “gradual fall,” used in these three Cases, are not merely analogous, but are in some sense identical, ‘then, in principle at least, it is possible that a material relation exists between the mental processes of a living creature, and the total impression made by movements of the creature’s limbs upon one who witnesses the moyement.” ‘The connection between emotion and movement, including instinctive movements, is thus conceiyable in a way which includes an understanding of the expressive movements.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_56_0	In our first chapter it was noted that certain real entities of behaviour correspond to the total impression which an animal’s behaviour makes upon us. In addition to other characteristics, no less important in solving this problem, every form of behaviour has a certain articulation or phrasing. ‘This articulation issues from a similar articulation of the central nervous processes of the acting individual. This central articulation in turn corresponds to the individual’s “ experience ” which is articulated in a like manner. Thus the perception in the mind of an onlooker, if it be so constituted as to embrace what is going on in the reagent, must itself possess a similar articulation. And hence the experience of the reagent A, and of the observant B, must resemble each other.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_57_0	Kohler elucidates this point with a striking example : When a pianist moved by his feelings articulates a series of muscular innervations with varying degrees of phrasing, fixed time-relations are determined in the series of soundwaves which constitute a sort of physical projection of the phrasing of his muscular innervations, thus conditioning in the mind of the listener an articulated auditory process which closely resembles the pianist’s own nervous articulations.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_58_0	These are the assumptions which Koffka and Kohler make, in order to explain the fact that recognition of facial expression and expressive gesture is a very primitive mental fact, attained to by apes and infants.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_59_0	It will at once be seen how closely these assumptions correspond with those forced upon the aesthetician who finds himself confronted with the fact that certain sounds and certain shapes are renderings of emotion recognisable without any considerable element of prearranged convention. But, as I have already said, the Gestalt psychologists seem to me to have rushed ahead somewhat rashly in a desire to state their case as simply as possible. We cannot be sure, for instance, that there is, scientifically speaking, a simple indivisible emotion corresponding with the idea of “fright.” Still less can we assign to such an emotion a definite “ configuration” expressible in words. Rejecting, therefore, this strictly schematic sort of resemblance, while clinging to the general principle, let us see what progress we can make by means of a glance at modern theories regarding the nature of emotion.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_60_0	Previously to the final years of the nineteenth century psychologists assumed that emotion was a separate function of mind, consisting of quite different “ stuff ” from that which constitutes other mental processes.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_61_0	This assumption was first questioned by William James and Lange, who simultaneously suggested that in the “ coarser ”? emotions, at any rate, such as grief, rage, and fear, the conscious element of the emotion consists of an awareness of the physical reactions—crying, staring, trembling, and so forth - which accompany these mental disturbances. As James playfully put it, “it would be truer to say that we are sorry because we cry, than that we cry because we are sorry.”
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_62_0	In its crudest form this hypothesis is open to a hundred obvious objections, but later research, by enlarging our knowledge of the more subtle physical reactions accompanying emotional disturbance, has placed it on a firmer footing. It seems, at any rate, quite reasonable to suppose that one ingredient of violent emotion is an awareness of certain changes in bodily secretion. We can well imagine such an awareness having just that vagueness and intensity which characterises intense emotion.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_63_0	But there have been recent researches which have attacked the analysis of emotion from a different angle. The study of morbid psychology by psychoanalysts has revealed a close co-ordination between the phases of emotion displayed in depressive-manic insanity (an unreasonable swing of mood between gloom and elation) and the phases of the patient’s repressed, semiconscious, stream of imagery. M‘Curdy sets forth the evidence on this point at some length in his recent Psychology of the Emotions. He reaches the conclusion that conscious emotion is a mixture of vague visceral sensation, such as we have already mentioned, and vague awareness of unsanctioned streams of imagery pursuing their course in some remote recess of the mind.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_64_0	As far, therefore, as the latest writers carry us we seem justified in assuming that the stuff of which emotion is made is just such stuff as that which constitutes the other mental processes, apart from its peculiar lack of what we may call precise outline. So much for its static aspect. But, as in all mental processes, there is another equally important aspect to be considered, the dynamic one. It has for a long time been recognised that our one clue to the grouping of emotional phenomena is the grouping of instincts. I think a little introspection — the only real test — will bring most people into agreement with the two propositions: (1) that all emotion is due either to the successful, or thwarted, progress of an instinctive motivation of some sort, and (2) that the individual qualities of different emotions correspond with differences in the following factor—which particular motivation, or blend of motivations, is concerned in each particular instance. Perhaps the most complete exposition of this idea is in M‘Dougall’s Social Psychology. But we need not here concern ourselves with any particular set of formule. For our purposes it is sufficient to assume that emotion consists of vague impressions patterned, or, as the Gestalt psychologists would say, “ configurated ” by the particular instinct, or combination of instincts, which happen at the moment to be active.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_65_0	What we require for our hypothesis is some aspect of sounds and shapes which will be capable of representing the various modes of arrangement characterising these miscellaneous entities whose principal quality is vagueness.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_66_0	Obviously we are dealing with material which takes us right away from the clear-cut impressions of sophisticated perception—the sort of awareness, for example, which tells us that our blotting-pad is rectangular and measures about 9 inches by 1 foot, or that the bird outside the window is a water-wagtail. Let us then seek our analogy in such impressions as lack the full precision and elaboration of ordinary cognitive consciousness, without falling into a sufficient degree of vagueness to become classed as emotion. For it is conceivable that in these instances we shall find consciousness reverting to some rudimentary stage in its development relevant to our problem.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_67_0	Consider, for example, my visual impression of things too small to be clearly visible yet too large to be wholly outside the range of sight—the little filaments, for example, which, as a microscope will tell me, make up my blotting-paper. The impression which they make upon my consciousness is one of texture. This impression seems to me curiously like the impression which my emotions make upon consciousness. It is perfectly individual. I should know the surface of blotting-paper, whatever its colour or size happened to be. Yet it is, from the point of view of sophisticated consciousness, vague. No words which I could formulate would enable me to transfer to an English-speaking inhabitant of Mars the power to recognise blotting-paper at a glance, whereas I could easily tell him the difference between “ foolscap ” and “ imperial.”” We have then, it seems to me, through the sense of texture, a glimpse into that region of rudimentary impression where emotions and perceptions most nearly meet.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_68_0	But we have considered one only of the possible factors which may deprive perception of its full development — small size. Brief duration occurs to me as another factor of this sort. Suppose, for example, that the bird outside, instead of keeping still to be looked at, flies away the moment I turn towards it. I might still be able to classify it simply by an impression of its mode of movement when in flight. Yet, once again as in the case of texture, this impression would be impossible to analyse into definite units, since any given instant of the bird’s flight has been too brief for separate observation as a single pose.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_69_0	Now I suggest that in mode of movement we have a second type of rudimentary impression, once more very comparable to the sort of impression which emotion makes upon consciousness, and that different modes of movement, as suggested by sound, colour, and form, may possess a recognisable resemblance to different phases of emotion. I am not suggesting that this translation of emotional flux into terms of plasticity or sound-structure is, except to a very limited degree, a normal function of the human mind. Were it so, we should all be artists. We do, as I see matters, all possess it in certain of its simpler forms, such as facial expression and involuntary gesture. The inflection of our daily speech, too, involves much natural expression curiously intermingled with the conventional use of words and meanings. For example, when a stranger in a railway carriage tells me, while sleet pours against the pane and wind howls through every chink in the compartment, that the weather is nasty, I cannot suppose that the vocal utterance he has made is in essence a transfer of information, as when some one says to me “ you ought to have changed at Crewe.” I must assume rather that it is a piece of abstract sound expressive of some phase (presumably gregarious) in his emotional state. The words which accompany this sound-structure are simply, like the burden of a corrupt ballad, bereft of sense.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_70_0	The crucial difference between the artist and the ordinary mortal which emerges from my hypothesis is this, that, while the ordinary mortal in ordinary gesture and conversation makes a shape- and sound-structure which roughly resembles the outstanding features of his emotional flux, the artist pushes the elaboration of his rendering much farther. It is not difficult to envisage the dance as a development of spontaneous gesticulation. But my contention is that we must go a step farther and envisage the significant form of a picture as accomplishing a sort of dance, imitative of the emotion which it serves to express.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_71_0	Again, it is not difficult to envisage song as a development of expressive vocal inflection. But here, too, I see no reason for shrinking from the conclusion that all musical art is an extension of the same principle, the principle of rendering emotional flux in terms of suggested movement up and down the range of pitch and intensity.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_72_0	If we accept these suppositions we are in a position to define the creative aesthetic faculty. It must be a sort of faculty of unconscious transposition, which, by the mediation of certain qualities which I have termed texture and mode of movement, translates a phase of emotional flux into terms of sound or shape.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_73_0	Such an hypothesis goes some way towards explaining the phenomena of artistic inspiration.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_74_0	The musician finds himself obsessed by certain arrangements of sound, and the painter by certain arrangements of shape and colour. Each is completely in the dark concerning the origin of his obsession, and knows nothing about it except that it demands peremptorily to be externalised. Is not this exactly what we should expect if these obsessive arrangements were really renderings, formed by a faculty working outside consciousness, of the patternings formed in the background of the mind by the functioning of fundamental motivations? One could even explain the compulsion towards externalisation by the essentially centrifugal character of instincts—their tendency, I mean, to pass into the outer world of physical action.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_75_0	Again this hypothesis renders the rarity of artistic genius very explicable. For a faculty of transposition so little related to the exigencies of daily life may well be as rare as the faculty, known to science but not widespread, of discerning prime numbers without the conscious intervention of intellect.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_76_0	A third point upon which I think that my hypothesis throws some light is the superiority of musical sound over mere noise as a medium of expression. Why, it may well be asked, should pure sound transcend mixed sound as a medium of expression to the degree by which song transcends the abstract-sound element of speech? My answer is that if both sorts of expression are renderings of mental events into modes of movement suggested by sound, then it will be easily understood that the richest resources of suggestion are possessed by sound subdivided into a finite range of pitch-qualities, so that complexity can be attained without chaos.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_77_0	I must not, of course, be understood to mean that the object of notation is to facilitate intellectual analysis. The moment we cease regarding a piece of music as an expressive whole and try to isolate separate notes, we cease to obtain from it any impression of an aesthetic sort. My point is that systematised sound provides the creative faculty with squared blocks, as it were. Noise provides only building-stone in the rough, units too irregular to fulfil any refined constructional purpose. It may reasonably be questioned why this principle of orderly notation seems to have no equivalent in the realm of shape and colour sufficiently within the range of comprehension to be described and analysed. An American, Professor Hambidge, has indeed detected some sort of proportionscale employed in Classical Greek art, but both he, and all other investigators of similar phenomena that I have ever come across, tend to ruin their research by aiming at the impossible. ‘They have it ever in view to discover some formula for absolute Beauty, instead of limiting their scope to the particular simplifications by means of which particular individuals or groups have square-hewed their units of construction. They are, in fact, direct descendants of the early aesthetician who discovered that composition should be “ serpentine, triangular, and divided by one, two, and three.”
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_78_0	If I may indulge in prophecy, I anticipate that the twentieth century will see many attempts to derive bases for decorative design from geometrical units, and, probably in conjunction with these, an effort to employ colour-cinematography in the service of a new art of abstract colour. At any rate, I am convinced that what is generally called colour-harmony contains a preponderant element of what should be called colour-melody, i.e. expressive movement up and down the colour-scale. To return, however, to expressive movement of form in plastic art.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_79_0	The first element which occurs to me is what we may call the cursive aspect of form, by which I mean the tendency of the original manual movements which fashioned the work to imprint upon that work traces which an observer may reconstruct in terms of expressive gesture.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_80_0	This element is, of course, very conspicuous in works which have been boldly handled, while in a miniature style it merges into the question of texture.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_81_0	The second is the element of suggested movement which the human mind tends to import into all questions of shape. Language is full of metaphors which prove the prevalence of this tendency.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_82_0	Ground “rises” to a peak and then “ falls away suddenly ” without a literal cataclysm. A row of trees is said to “ go’ in a straight line. ‘This property of form, its power to suggest movement, has engaged the attention of exstheticians from very early times. Hogarth suggested that Beauty led the eye through the mazes of an intricate and enjoyable dance. In the middle of the ninsieenth century Lipps added the suggestion that the process is one of personification—Linfublung,—and that we imagine ourselves to be executing the movements which we attribute to the shapes we are looking at. This doctrine, which seems sound enough as far as it goes, was elaborated—I should hesitate to say “ improved upon ”’—by the later “ empathists ” in England.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_83_0	They encumbered it with a theory of eye-movement, and envisaged aesthetic enjoyment as a sort of involuntary Swedish drill, resulting in a better physical tone for the whole system. The tide of their speculation was, however, soon checked by some American laboratory work which showed that their assumptions concerning eyemovement were wholly fallacious.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_84_0	Both Lipps and his disciples seem to me to have suffered principally from the fault which beset almost all aestheticians previous to Croce. They overlooked the distinction between the pleasure evoked by natural objects and the pleasure evoked by art. Consequently they plunged straight into the middle (or end, rather) of the aesthetic problem—the effect produced by the work of art—and began asking what sort of shapes do people enjoy looking at ? whereas they might more profitably have begun at the beginning and asked: “‘ How is it that any one is able to use form as a medium of emotional expression ? ”’
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_85_0	They would then, I believe, have found themselves forced to conclusions similar to those here put forward. They would have seen that we get no farther by asserting that certain shapes “lead us a dance,” unless we can explain the fundamental nature of dancing.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_86_0	Now obviously the problem of why people dance is inseparable from the problem of why they dither with their fingers when agitated, and so forth. And the “ Gestalt ” explanation that finger-dithering is really an externalised copy of the muddled mental events which constitute “ feeling distracted,” seems to me far the most convincing yet put forward. I do not therefore see how the conclusion is to be avoided that, when forms in art affect us by means of suggested movement, our mental reaction is really a recognition of the original emotion in the artist’s mind which those forms represent. Why his substantiation of those forms, and our recognition of them, should be pleasurable processes is a question which we shall attack at a later stage of our argument.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_87_0	I ought not, perhaps, to take leave of this question of significant form without reverting to the part played by “proportion,” by which I mean the relationship of measurements taken at an angle of go° to each other. Our conception of form seems to hover round the rectangularity of spatial units. Hence are derived all such antitheses as thin and thick, tall and squat, narrow and broad, which have so distinct an emotional flavouring that I am not sure proportion ought not to be in a category by itself as a vehicle of expression.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_88_0	With these considerations I shall close for the moment my analysis of the relationship between emotion and significant form. :
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_89_0	Before proceeding to that which would logically come next—an analysis of the relationship between “ images of things ” and “ thoughts ” in the artist’s mind and the same items as they reappear in his work—I shall turn aside to take a glance at an aspect of art which I haye hitherto disregarded, its association with rhythm.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_90_0	By rhythm I mean repetitive structure. It is necessary to emphasise this because the word is indiscriminately used to describe both the nature of what is repeated, and the fact that repetitive structure exists. In the former sense it is practically equivalent to the “ suggested movement ” element of significant form. I therefore propose to narrow its meaning down to the latter sense, for the sake of clearness.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_91_0	Thus, in my vocabulary, the rippled surface of the sea or the hum of a threshing-machine is “ rhythmic,” because both consist of a repetition of similar units. But neither is “ significant,” since neither contains a rendering of mental events. An individual may render them significant relative to himself by reading into their “pure form” a resemblance to something going on in his own mind, but in that case he has begun to suffer from symptoms of inspiration, and the fault, if one may So put it, is not with the sea or the machine. In our sense it can only be the resulting pictures or poems which are “ significant.” :
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_92_0	Now the problem with which we are faced is this: Why is rhythm in our sense omnipresent in art ? The answer which I suggest is that the creative mind employs rhythm to produce in itself a state in which the aesthetic faculty can function freely, that, in a word, every bout of zxsthetic activity must be accompanied by a sort 0 self-hypnotism.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_93_0	It is, of course, now regarded as axiomatic that intellectual functioning involves the suppression of certain primitive mental processes. If we wish these processes to regain their activity we have to lull the intellect into quiescence.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_94_0	Thus, for example, by hypnotism we resuscitate the complete suggestibility of the herd-animal (some authorities, naively, as I feel, assert that what we resuscitate is an infantile attitude of suggestibility towards the parent). Or, again by hypnotism, we can resuscitate repetitive memory, which reels off past experience with mechanical precision, and is regarded as the prototype of “ synthetic ” memory. ‘Thus there would seem to be some ground, on argument by analogy, for the supposition that aesthetic activity and intellectual activity are mutually exclusive. That they are at any rate independent is more easily demonstrable by means of the observed phenomena of insanity, for it has been found that a certain degree of impaired intellect exercises no deleterious effect on the creative and executant aesthetic faculties. An interesting point is that as the breakdown of mental organisation proceeds the aesthetic faculties vanish in a fixed order. First prose becomes impossible, then verse, then painting or drawing, then sculpture, and finally music. This demonstrates that those arts depend least upon intellect which depend most upon significant form.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_95_0	Granting then, to resume our argument, that some parallel may fairly be drawn between the phenomena of hypnotism and the phenomena of aesthetic activity, let us see how this assumption helps us towards understanding the function of rhythm.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_96_0	In the first place, we may note the effect of any impressions which happen to possess rhythmic qualities. For example, when we look long at the sea or listen long to a threshing-machine, we become curiously drowsy, just as we do when swung in a hammock or massaged rhythmically. ‘This, of course, is not the same thing as going off into a hypnotic trance, but since almost all rhythmic stimuli are found to be an aid to hypnotism, we may assume that this drowsiness and the hypnotic trance are closely related.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_97_0	Accordingly, one conclusion which I wish to state at this point is that the repetitive structure of art represents some mechanism working in the mind of the artist as a sedative of intellect.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_98_0	The musician repeats over and over to himself the phrase he finds obsessing his mind. The artist imposes first upon one part of his subject and then upon another his obsessive configurations of form and colour. The poet reiterates his obsessive cadences. I envisage the process as a sort of circular system involving the mutual reinforcement of the agencies at work, obsession leading to repetition, and repetition stimulating the forces which lead to obsession. When we come to the question of aesthetic pleasure we shall return to our analysis of the mental modifications produced by rhythm.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_99_0	Logical sequence demands that we should deal next with the relationship between ‘‘images of things” and “thoughts” in the artist’s mind, and the same items as they reappear in his work.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_100_0	Now here the difficulties which confront us are quite different. When we considered the relationship between emotion and significant form, and suggested that it was one of resemblance, the difficulty seemed to be that we were seeking to compare two utterly heterogeneous entities. :
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_101_0	Cognitive consciousness and the outside world seem on the contrary to have a vast amount in common. It is as though the relationship between mind and matter were that of a plastic material pressed against a hard mould. Cognition bears the imprint of objective reality. Between a mental image of a tree and a painted tree in a picture we feel no gulf, nor again between a thought in the mind and the same thought uttered or written. Accordingly, these elements of art present no problem of expression such as is presented by emotion and abstract form. Imposing upon the aesthetician no obvious necessity for hard thought, these elements have, until a quite recent date, furnished him with the material for much elegant discourse. It may then be questioned why I propose to expend a certain amount of space on an aspect of art which after centuries of desultory discussion now tends to be dismissed as wholly negligible.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_102_0	The answer is this. Just at the moment, when this particular region of aesthetics appeared to be on the point of utter desolation, it has been resown with a crop of promising problems. I refer to the speculations of Freud. According to Freud, the artist is in essence a dreamer who has the gift of creating material productions by means of which he shares his dreams with others. In the nineteenth century such a statement would have passed as an agreeable platitude. To-day it involves us in formidable difficulties. In particular, it implies two tenets which we must examine with some care.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_103_0	In the first place, there is the question of symbolism. To begin with, we must decide what we are to denote by the word. In its widest sense it seems to me legitimate to call any material entity which can conceivably be relied upon to evoke any particular mental event the “ symbol of that event. But for the purposes of this essay, I propose to narrow down the meaning of the word to the particular case of what we may call “ disguised ” symbols, round which this controversy centres.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_104_0	Freud maintains that dreams are a sort of reversal of the current of consciousness. Instead of seeing certain things which cause you to have certain feelings, as occurs in waking consciousness, you have feelings which cause you to see things. ‘The feelings in question are attributed y him to the efforts of thwarted instincts to find an outlet during the temporary abeyance of “ inhibition ”— the tyranny, that is to say, of newly acquired, civilised motivations.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_105_0	The things which one sees are objects connected in various ways with the particular instinct concerned, and Freud’s belief is that these objects, suspected as they are by “the Censor ” of complicity in unsanctioned mental movements, are under the necessity of adopting a disguise when they appear in consciousness. Our old security in supposing that things in pictures and events in literature are neither more nor less than what they superficially appear to be (putting aside all question of abstract form), thus crumbles at a touch. We move, as at a bal masqué, among figures that may at any moment have an utterly unexpected identity fastened upon them. Already, following on Freud’s Leonardo da Vinci, a new school of art-criticism is springing up which seeks to correlate the content of the artist’s work with his “ complexes.” In a matter so little susceptible of experimental demonstration all argument seems futile. According to temperament, one is either irritated or interested by this type of speculation. ‘Those aestheticians who had hoped to keep attention centred upon abstract form naturally both resent and deride a line of thought which resuscitates interest in subject-matter. The same persons also bitterly resent the second suggestion implicit in Freud’s dreamtheory, the suggestion that art is a form of wish-fulfilment. I must admit that Freud himself in his Psychopathology of Everyday Life seems to go out of his way to expose hims to criticism. The artist, he says, wishes for, and lacks, love, power, and riches. He
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_105_1	obtains hallucinatory fulfilment of these wishes in day-dreams, which he transmutes into a concrete, communicable form, and thereby gets some, at any rate, of the things he started out by wanting. In further pees of wish-fulfilment as the essence of art he adds a reproduction of an aesthetically negligible picture representing a prisoner dreaming that an elf is sawing asunder his prison bars. In the circumstances, it really seems to be his own fault if he is pilloried as an advocate of that sort of art which appeals to lust, snobbery, and silly optimism rather than to aesthetic sensitivity—the Academy nude, for example, the magazine-cover and the below-stairs feuilleton with a happy ending. Now so long as wish-fulfilment is interpreted in the sense in which Freud himself appears to interpret it in this particular passage, these criticisms are perfectly valid. The sort of “wishes” which he here enumerates correspond with our English use of the word in that they are directions of conscious effort, easy to define and describe.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_106_0	But a wider study of Freud’s work shows that the meaning which he generally attaches to the same German word considerably transcends in scope our English “ wish.” It really covers the whole field of life’s dynamic aspect. According to my hypothesis art is indeed wish-fulfilment, using the word in the wide sense indicated, and that in two distinct ways.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_107_0	In the first place, I regard the emotion-significant form equation as involving a sort of wishor (if one does not mind the word) motivation-fulfilment. We have assumed, it will be remembered, that the patterning of emotion is principally determined by the blend of motivations active at the moment. We have also assumed that the translation of this patterning into material form acts in some way as a sort of substitutive outlet for the motivation. Abstract form in art may therefore be regarded as a fulfilment of “ wishes,” which thus find an outlet in an earlier stage of their development than seems to be contemplated either by Freud or his opponents.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_108_0	In the second place, I regard my hypothesis that the content of art is subjectively arranged as equivalent to admitting the question of wish-fulfilment into the discussion, since by “subjective”? I mean “ patterned according to the proclivities of the individual ” as opposed to “patterned according to the structure of external reality.” This part of my hypothesis might seem so self-evident that we must pause to consider why the idea of wish-fulfilment in art has met with such formidable opposition. One reason I have already suggested, that this diversion of thought from the problem of significant form is deprecated. A second which I suspect, is that the phrase wish-fulfilment seems to suggest an element of the haphazard. Very rightly the aesthetician insists that there is no such element in art, and, calling to mind that science also excludes it, he rather rashly groups together artists and scientists in antithesis to the plain man.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_109_0	The fallacy of this line of thought seems to me to be the assumption that logic is the sole possible principle by means of which chaos can be avoided. In my view, art avoids chaos because it consists in co-ordinating form with certain mental processes which are in themselves essentially systematic—as what vital structure is not? But the term logical in its literal sense does not refer to structure of this kind. It refers to a particular aspect of a particular sort of mental process. We can only extend it beyond that use by a picturesque but “ logically ” (I use the word with intention) worthless metaphor.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_110_0	The artist and scientist, as distinct from the ordinary mortal, have indeed this in common, that they both aim at a unified and purified type of mental process. They differ from one another in this, that each attains his unity by excluding as far as possible that which is most essential to the other.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_111_0	The next point with which I must deal is, therefore, the degree to which the artist finds this exclusion impossible. For it is quite clear that, apart perhaps from music, all art does owe a certain limited allegiance to objective reality.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_112_0	I remember in my earlier days of aesthetic curiosity being shown pictures of very crooked coffee-pots, and being told that I must not mind them being crooked, because they were bits of “ pure form” and not mere culinary utensils.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_113_0	It puzzled me then to know why “ purity ” of form should distort objects, and how I could possibly help feeling discomforted by distortion of this kind. And, if I felt discomforted, what was to become of aesthetic pleasure ?
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_114_0	I feel now that I can formulate some vague ideas as to the incompatibility between literal representation and an arrangement of form suggestive of expressive movement. But my feeling that an awareness of too obvious infringements against objective truth prevents aesthetic pleasure still remains. In fact, I feel inclined to amplify it along the lines of my main theory. It occurs to me as probable that an awareness of distortion destroys aesthetic pleasure by arousing intellectual activity. To detect such distortion at all is a semi-intellectual process, and tends inevitably to be followed by such wholly intellectual questions as, “ What exactly is wrong?” From this point of view we begin to realise how the plastic artist’s interest in grasping the structurally essential features of the form he represents differs from the scientist’s interest in objective realities. The artist has to grasp these features only because he needs to make his draughtsmanship convincing, without tying himself down to the literal lines of his subject at too many points. A grasp of the essential, as distinct from the incidental, qualities of the form he is dealing with enables him to do this, to produce, in fact, the maximum impression, with the minimum real presence, of objective truth.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_115_0	Before taking leave of my comparison between art and science I should like to touch on its historical aspect. Art is unable to consolidate any progress (outside the sphere of pure technique) which it may from time to time make. Accordingly its history shows us a precariously balanced performance wobbling between non-significant copying and mere chaos up and down the same length of rope. Science, on the other hand, progresses in a steady straight line away from subjectivity. We used, for example, to believe that the human body and soul were unique simply because our egotism made us wish them to be. Darwin and Freud compel us to recognise an irksome relationship to the animal world which we had tried to disavow.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_116_0	We now come to the problem of aesthetic pleasure. It is a very difficult one, which has repeatedly baffled research. At any rate we have the advantage of approaching it with some semblance of proper preparation, a glance, that is to say, at the processes which precede it. This very obvious precaution is one which the nineteenth century, following Fechner, conspicuously omitted to make. For this sin of our fathers we still suffer, since we find foisted upon us a pseudo-science of experimental zesthetics.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_117_0	It may come as a shock to my readers to learn that psychological laboratories quite recently existed — may still exist for all I know — where anyone who could be induced to waste a sufficient amount of time was confronted with cards displaying simple geometrical figures or single colours, and asked which he liked best, and why ; and that it was believed that statistics compiled from this sort of test might throw some light on the fundamental problems of aesthetic pleasure.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_118_0	I quite realise that these psychologists use the word “ aesthetic ” in a wider sense than Ihave done. For them it includes, in effect, the whole pleasure-displeasure aspect of sensory impression. ‘This latitude of terminology has, however, an unfortunate effect upon. their researches into the problem now before us. They come blundering into the sequence of art-experience at its final stage, without looking back, and distracted by a host of irrelevant considerations. For example, taste, smell, and touch immediately claim inclusion. One would have thought that the fact of expressive arts having risen up around hearing and sight, and not around the other senses, would have aroused them to some suspicion as to the value of their methods. The very contrary event took place. They sought to investigate the basis of agreeable form by the same sort of technique as might be used for investigating the preferences of the palate or nostril. They seem to disregard the fact that the more rudimentary senses give what one may call “emphatic positive or negative answers” to questions of preference, both because they are less discriminating and because they are more closely linked with vital instinct than hearing or sight. Thus sweet tastes evoke a “ positive ” answer because the human palate has not yet adjusted itself to the world - abundance of sugar, and there is a certain peremptoriness about this answer because the palate and the nutritive instincts are closely associated. Sounds and sights are normally only reacted to
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_118_1	after intellectual deliberation. But there are various exceptions to this rule, of which reaction to art is one. (Blinking when dazzled is another.) Between these exceptions and full ratiocination lie all sorts of visual and auditory reaction which for one reason or another evade clear intellectual analysis. Somewhere in this limbo 1 should place reaction to test-cards. Almost all these reactions find themselves confused with each other, and with those reactions, which are simply sign-posts for nutrition or sex, in the “ aesthetic” reaction of the oldfashioned psychological laboratory. In these circumstances there is nothing surprising about their failure to make much headway. Warned by their failure let us proceed prudently.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_119_0	There are two directions in which I propose to push the process of exploration. ‘Two main ideas have dominated this essay, expression and subjectivity, and I believe that in each lies an element of aesthetic pleasure. Tolstoy, with his eye ever open for spiritual expedients, saw in art, as a form of expression, a method of communion between individuals, a link binding men together. This teleological view of art is somewhat outside my scope, but one supposition which my hypothesis clearly involves is that a function which is directly descended from the expressive sounds and gestures of the animal world may in many cases subserve the ends of herdinstinct.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_120_0	To a certain extent I think that it is probably true that the artist aims at communicating his emotions to others and saving himself from solitude. But it also seems probable that the mere making of a work of art acts as an outlet for the motivation which it expresses, and to this extent aesthetic pleasure must be the sensation of relief brought to the organism by the successful functioning of a safety-valve.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_121_0	Another criticism upon the communication theory of aesthetic pleasure is that the amount of gratification received seems curiously independent of the content of the communication made. Thus a picture of death and pillage gives as much pleasure, other things being equal, as a picture of a tea-party. Yet unesthetic communications, as newspaper reports, for example, depress or elate us in accordance with their content — we are pleased to hear of happiness and harassed by atrocities.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_122_0	This curious phenomenon of pleasurable feeling devoid of any obvious utilitarian aspect suggests to me a set of parallel instances not generally recognised as relevant to the problem of aesthetic pleasure.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_123_0	Thus there is a stage in being half-hanged, half-drowned, or half-stunned, which is reported to be pleasurable. Ishould perhaps not have credited these reports had I not experienced the last variety myself. There is a pleasurable stage in the early instants of an epileptic fit, vividly described by Dostoievsky. From Dostoievsky’s description of the sudden sense of cosmic order and unity which characterises this experience it is but a short step to the Nirvana of religious self-hypnotism by concentration of thought, or the giddy exultation of the dancing Dervish. Nor again can the relevance of the pleasure-component in intoxication by alcohol and other drugs be wholly disregarded, although in these instances the direct stimulation of vital organs rather complicates the question.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_124_0	I think that the conception, which I have tried to keep in prominence throughout this essay, of intellect acting as the organ of contact with objective reality, gives us the means of grouping all these phenomena together as evasions of contact with objectivity by diminution of intellectual functioning. It is a biological fact that when the efficiency of an organism wanes the first functions to fail are those which have been most recently acquired.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_125_0	The phenomena which I have enumerated are all, in different ways, attacks upon vital efficiency. ‘Therefore the first result in each case is a drop in intellectual activity. I suggest that for the average human being contact with the objective world is a source of more pain than pleasure, and that the pleasure-component in this group of experiences represents relief due to the lessening of this contact. The essence of such trances seems to me to be this: that they enable a man to forget his past and his probable future, and the famine in China and the life in London, and the last war and the next war, and live for a moment like an infusorial organism with consciousness narrowed down to the pin-point of the present instant and the single self, freed temporarily from the fetters of objective oppression. ‘The unity which the ecstatic mystic reads into the universe is, I maintain, merely a projection of the unity restored to his own mind by a temporary truce between the conflicting elements therein—fundamental subjective functioning and superimposed objective adaptation to environment ; the terms of the truce being a temporary abandonment of activity by the faculties which pass on, as it were, the pressure of the outer world.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_126_0	The analogy of the happy lunatic who lives in a fool’s paradise of pure subjectivity occurs to the mind, but here I think we are in danger of doing an injustice to the mystic. May not he, looking inwards, see much that others, looking outwards, fail to note? Have men been utterly mistaken in seeking philosophic guidance from the poets ? We may, perhaps, justify their expectation somehow thus. Many thinkers have regarded terrestrial progress as the resultant of two factors—Mind, a force which keeps shifting the direction of its ever-increasing pressure; and Matter, a dead mass against which this living force thrusts. May not the poet, in his subjective trance, by increased awareness of his own mental processes foresee the first symptoms of Mind’s next move, just as increased subjective physical sensitivity in sleep sometimes produces dreams of sore throats and so forth, which actually materialise some days later ?
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_127_0	Thus the great religious teachers of two thousand years ago felt a sympathetic and imaginative compunction towards the sufferings of all living things, which may quite possibly become a common mental characteristic of the whole human race two thousand years hence.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_128_0	I must now pass to a point whose discussion has hitherto been crowded out, the reason why rhythmic impressions exercise a peculiar effect upon consciousness. We have already noticed in some detail the hypnotic effect of such impressions, and we have had occasion to mention the fact that similar results can be obtained by fastening attention down to a single point, as in Buddhist meditation, rather than stimulating it repetitively. That the intellect can be affected by a bang on the head or a dose of some drug seems to us natural enough, but its sensitivity to anything so intangible as mere repetition or immobilisation of impressions appears somehow paradoxical. May not the explanation be something of this kind—that irregular movement is the natural gait of intellectual functioning, and that it is unable-either to progress with measured regularity or to stay still. If you compel it to do either of these things it simply breaks down. Mere matter, on the other hand, has of course immobility, of a sort, as its natural state, and when this immobility is disturbed the next most natural state seems to be one of rhythmical movement.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_129_0	Thus all simple disturbances of equilibrium result in rhythm, as when a pendulum receives a single push or a tree sways in a steady wind. ‘This rule the movement of heart and lungs, and perhaps all vital processes except intellect, follow.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_130_0	Irregular movement can only be accounted for by the intervention of some complicating factor, as when a kitten plays with the pendulum, or an eddy of conflicting air-currents blows a leaf from the tree hither and thither. Some complicating factor of this kind seems to be involved in the workings of the intellect. ‘The least rhythmical of all conversations are those in which a complicated idea is being intelligently discussed. Conversely it is amusing, when one is being anathematised by excitable persons, to note how their stream of vociferation slips more and more into a regular rhythm as their words recede farther and farther from logical sense.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_131_0	There is another point with which I must attempt to deal now that I have set my hand to tidying up the frayed ends projecting from the fabric of what has gone before. I feel that I have been unjust to the experimental aestheticians. However hasty their postulates may seem, one must face the fact that on some points there has been a curious uniformity in their results. Almost all their subjects prefer lines to be divided at or near the proportion 1: 1-618. They all prefer triangles which do not look as if they were toppling over, and curves which stick to some system. How are we to account for all this? I suggest that we can do so without assuming that the mind of the normal man quits during these experiments its usual groove of practical reaction to environment. The proportions near “ the golden mean” are suggested to him by his very practical propensity towards compromise—he won’t divide the line either very equally or very unequally. He doesn’t like the triangle to look unstable because things which actually tumble down, and falls experienced by oneself, are generally a nuisance. He likes curves to be systematic because system is always a useful principle, even in business. It seems to me quite possible that all laboratory observations of this sort have only the remotest bearing on the passive aesthetic experience of sensitivity to art. That there may be some fixed canons of Beauty—if we choose to employ the word
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_131_1	—I do not deny. Nor could it well be otherwise, since certain factors in certain arts enjoy a certain degree of fixity. The painter has to concentrate visual attention within a finite space, and avoid lines leading the eye ouside his frame.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_132_0	The musician has to avoid simultaneous sound impressions which would confuse the perceptive faculty of hearing. But to try to take an aesthetic short-cut by assuming that the nose, palate, and touch have inscrutable preferences of their own, and then modelling on this analogy such phrases as “ pleasing to the eye,” “ pleasing to the ear,” seems to me simply a sort of colloquial personification of the senses quite devoid of scientific support.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_133_0	Unless we are utterly to revise our psychological axioms we must assume that the senses merely mediate an impression, of which some larger totality behind them feels either approval or disapproval. It has been with the workings of this larger totality that I have tried to concern myself in this essay.
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_134_0	I may perhaps be pardoned if, before I end, I attempt to anticipate certain lines of opposition which I foresee that I am bound to arouse. ‘here are certain persons who like art, but believe themselves to hate emotion, and therefore desire a theory of art excluding all mention of it. I suspect such people of confusing “ emotion,” a normal attribute of the mind, with “ emotionality,” the abnormal inflammation of this attribute. They have my hearty concurrence in deploring this latter state. But need they go yet farther, deny any sort of emotion any place in art, and even assert, contrary to the whole trend of such evidence as we possess, that art ought to be “ intellectual ” ?
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_135_0	Again, there are certain other persons who like art and hate abstract thought. ‘To them my theories will seem far-fetched. They will tend to endorse such views as those of a critic who stated recently that for him art was nothing but “ the characteristic use of medium.”
1-15-revival-aesthetics	doc_5_136_0	Having myself made numerous efforts to produce works of art, I have hardly had the opportunity to overlook the influence of medium on form, even if I have failed hitherto to make any reference to this factor, since no explanation seemed to be needed of its place in my hypothesis. Nor again do I quarrel with their aspiration towards keeping their feet on firm ground. But the accomplishment of their aspiration seems to me to be too dearly purchased, when they thereby sacrifice their outlook over all but a limited corner of the aesthetic problem.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_0_0	THE CHARACTER OF JOHN DRYDEN
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_1_0	DRYDEN, considering his stature, his simplicity, and the satisfactory nature of everything he wrote, is sur prisingly elusive. Reading him, one is aware of the pre sence of a character as solid as Dr Johnson ; but look for him, and he is not there: the lines of the human figure dissolve, as you turn, into those of the literature of his age. For he never undertook a task which fashion or interest might not have offered: so much, though professing to despise it, he confessed. And while in this there is nothing peculiar, he shows a rarer symptom in his attitude towards these tasks. Many others, in their original choice of a form to work upon, have been guided more by the necessity of earning a living than by: their own unfettered taste. But those who succeed, those who make some- thing really great out of the material submitted to them, seldom do so, one would think, without acquiring in the business some affection for that which, though foreign in the first place, they have made properly their own. Dryden had none of this parental feeling, and remained all his life quite uninterested in the forms which he had so distinguished. And his critical prefaces, though ostensibly written to explain or defend his particular methods of practice, are inspired solely by his delight in the general discussion of literature.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_2_0	Nor is it true, what is often asserted, that he was unfortunate in the fashions which he submitted to. He himself recognised, and complained, that the writing of comedies, which occupied so much of his middle life was unfitted to his talents: but, for all that, he made no effort to escape from this servitude, on which he was not, even financially, utterly dependent. And then the vogue for translations and adaptations, which gave him the crowning opportunities of his old age, was, for him, extraordinarily lucky, no less than the political crisis which swept him accidentally into his most brilliant triumphs. It is true that in the Preface to Juvenal and Persius he states that the ambition of his life, from which events had kept him, had been to write a British national epic; but it is possible that what he had in his mind was in fact accomplished by the original work which emerged from his rehandling of Boccaccio and Chaucer. Had he taken, as he suggested, the Black Prince’s campaigns for his subject, he would not have had so free a hand ; and the difference between his epic and Froissart could hardly have been so wholly advantageous to the former, as was that between Cymon and Iphigenia, say, and the corresponding story in the Decameron. ‘The national epic might conceivably have been more widely read ; it could hardly have been of greater value.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_3_0	But all through Dryden’s work, even in those forms with which he was least at ease, a certain unity is felt, of which he himself seems to suggest the explanation. For there are innumerable passages, in his earlier as in his later writings, which hint, or even state, that his permanent object was to refine the English language. The rest is easy. His whole body of work can be exlained as the child of a deep enthusiasm, which made him attach but little importance to religion or politics, or even to many aspects of literature itself. What excluded everything else was the love of expression for ‘ts own sake. He devoted himself therefore to increasing the efficiency of his instruments.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_4_0	His own confessions, then, suggest that he should be venerated as the great improver, and, further, that he should be explained as having applied himself to that work deliberately throughout his life. However, to say that a man wrote better than his fellows is not to say that he improved. Improving an instrument means enlarging its scope, not wielding it with greater dexterity, — an important distinction, if the nature of Dryden’s improvements is to be examined.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_5_0	His age was professedly one of improvement. Waller and Denham had arrived and brought the “reformation of our numbers.” Verse was taking on its brightest graces ; prose discarding encumbrances and allowing an author’s mind to show its movement freely, like a naked body. And Dryden excelled in both, and was aware that a process of the kind was being carried out ; but whether by his own work he either guided or accelerated it, and whether, if he did, he worked at that deliberately, are difficult questions. For his prose is in many ways the most perfect of his time: it is sometimes praised as the most modern; but, nevertheless, it could be maintained that had he never lived, English prose, though losing one of its most splendid ornaments, would have developed subsequently exactly as it has done, for he was devoid of invention, and took gladly (so we may believe in spite of his grumbling) whatever came to hand. He excelled not so much by improving prose and verse as by using them as they then existed, up to the very limits of their powers. An adroit practician, with an amazing flair for making the best of what he has, may never notice certain limitations ; while less adaptable as well as more original minds may be so conscious of them as to feel it necessary to make experiments in order to their removal. But his brain was pre-eminently supple; and he had no new thing to say.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_5_1	Accordingly, he was not of those who enlarge the scope of a language or a style, and without too great extravagance one might plausibly argue that Boyle, who as a handler of words was remarkably uninspired, in the end assisted English more than Dryden. Substitute Bishop Berkeley for Boyle and the contention would be easy. For although Boyle had little appreciation of the degree to which the philosopher depends upon words, or of the delicate, caressing study which they demand, yet he tried to think on original lines, and passionately wished to make the way plain for others to follow where he had gone as an adventurer. Now, from strenuous thinking of that kind new styles might indeed be born, or old refashioned. But Dryden was the exact opposite of Boyle ; he loathed original thought —of course in others he respected it as much as any, but he loathed the effort of it in himself. As against that, however, he loved writing for its own sake, both his own and other people’s. And since writing came easily to him, his body of work is large.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_6_0	Questions of influence are dubious at the best. But Dryden, whatever he may have thought of his position among them, was one of a number of English writers who were moving definitely and, what is more, consciously in a certain direction. Some of them at times complained that nothing was being done, but many professed to have a clear idea of what they wanted, and of how to get it. And the end in view was a greater intellectual freedom—not, this time, for the mind within itself, because that had been already won and made secure, but for the communication bétween minds, and for their knowledge of each other. The most literary of them, then, felt that their business was less to create ideas than to assist, as it were, their fertilisation. They quite realised that the motive power of improvement was coming from beyond them: they could at most facilitate its development a little here or there. But that little was all-important. And the recognition of it led to proposals for the founding of an authoritative literary academy, as a branch of the Royal Society.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_7_0	One thinks now of academies of this kind as being necessarily either deadening or futile; but this one presented itself very differently to its enthusiastic founders. It was to be a kind of athletic training-ground, in which the members should help in divesting each other of useless conventions, like “‘ luxury and redundance of speech,” returning to a “ primitive purity and shortness,” with the modesty that should befit a “land of experimental knowledge.” In fact the only object which these academicians really set before themselves was to leave original thought as free a course as possible, by insuring that it should be able to appear in a perfectly direct and unambiguous form, while fallacies should no longer allure the innocent by decking themselves meretriciously as ““ seeming mysteries.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_8_0	They realised, then, that a change in English prose was taking place, and though some of them may have thought that it could be controlled more than such processes in practice can, yet they did not deceive themselves so far as to think that they were deliberately keeping it in motion. Just as it was impossible for them to revert to earlier habits of thought, so was it unthinkable that a man should be able to write in the style of his forebears. It was as clean against nature that a member of the Royal Society should write like Sir Thomas Browne, as that he should believe in witches — unless he were Bishop Glanville ; and even that eccentric strove against Nullibists, Holenmerians, and such, in ways that might have horrified the simplicity of King James I.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_9_0	There are no two ways of saying the same thing. ‘So many thoughts in so many words,” said the cognoscenti of the Royal Society: and if one can be said to precede the other, it is thoughts which must find words to breed in. So that at a time of intellectual advancement the men who, as far as language is concerned, are forcing the pace are those whose brains are pioneering, But before newly discovered country can be opened up to ordinary traffic, roads must be constructed. So, too, in the use of language, we may compare prose to the roads which must be built ; and although the explorers (or the original thinkers) and the exploiters (or the developers of prose) may be different persons, the latter, one would think, must have, if not the talent of the pioneers, at any rate their ardour; the same impelling discontent, though different ways of acting on it.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_10_0	Dryden, however, exhibits no such haste, and it again becomes clear that he loved writing entirely for its own sake — assuming, that is, that he really loved it. For, as far as invention goes, he had less to say than most. And even the second point, the eager following (as opposed to mere admiring) of creative originality in others, would scarcely be found well exemplified in him. In politics, in religion, and in literature itself, though in no sense a reactionary, he was a grand conservative. But his conservatism came not from timidity, not from laziness, not from snobbish conceit or suspicion, but rather from intense and passionate gusto, from ardent enjoyment of life as it was, from anxiety to seize and incorporate into himself all his surroundings. And if that was the thing most worth doing, the conclusion was obvious. Wherever he looked he found God’s plenty in nature and in art. To understand and to enjoy all this was more than enough to fill the capacities of a human life, whose hours were too precious to waste in any doubtful scheme of change.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_11_0	This conservative attitude especially marked his views on religion, which are very plainly expressed in The Hind and the Panther and Religio Latci (to look no farther). The latter is in some sort a companion-to Lord Halifax’s Character of a Trimmer; for from an expression of the scholar’s appreciation of the gulf that lies between absolute truth on the one hand, and, on the other, man’s most hopeful conception of it, it points out the final unimportance of what a man may believe, as compared with the practical results of holding such a faith in the actual world he lives in. Dryden shows, again, that for a limited being like man to begin to understand an infinite God is a simple impossibility. How vain, then, for men to search for God, though they reverence Him never so much, with a rational understanding, whose true object is the sufficiently intricate question of their relations with their fellow-men—
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_12_0	Private reason ’tis more just to curb, Than by disputes the public peace disturb : For points obscure are of small use to learn, But common quiet is mankind’s concern.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_13_0	While, therefore, the Papists with their obscurantism and claim to infallible interpretation, and the Nonconformists with their “ infallibility in the private spirit ” were equally astray, the latter, at least, were more ridiculous, because less rational—
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_14_0	Study and pains were now no more their care ; Texts were explained by fasting and by prayer.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_15_0	Dryden himself, being so rational as to make no extravagant claims for the powers of his own reason, recognised how desirable infallibility would be, wherever residing, if only it could be found. But he saw as the only claimants the “ dark lantern of the spirit,” or, alternatively, what Lord Halifax described as ‘‘ good resolute nonsense backed with authority.” But since ‘ common quiet ” is the only earthly test that can be applied, the “ resolute nonsense ” may become the best of sense, if the authority which backs it is the general agreement of mankind to use it as a common standard: and though you have not, there, infallibility in its strictest meaning, yet you have something which, by providing exactly similar adyantages, may without danger be allowed the name, if it demands it.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_16_0	Of course this is not quite what Dryden said in Religio Laici, but it represents a position which its author was so clearly approaching that when, soon afterwards, he embraced Rome and wrote The Hind and the Panther, whatever may be thought of his sincerity, his action was certainly not inconsistent. For it can always be referred to one continuously held position — that of the man to whom quarrelling over questions whose resolution is obviously set beyond the limits of this life would seem not only impertinent (as he would have said) but also dangerous. Men may lose irrevocably what they possess in the heat of struggling for the unattainable. For life seemed so full of things there, actually, ready to be enjoyed and capable of absorbing all the human faculties in their enjoyment, that it partook either of blind stupidity or else of ingratitude and headlong conceit for a man to dismiss the unexhausted (perhaps inexhaustible) present, in an attempt, as restless as it was vain, to accelerate and mould an already destined future.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_17_0	Now if all this has any bearing upon his work, the point of it must be, that in a long and productive life, lived very closely in the world, Dryden never changed or advanced his position, he merely perfected it, remaining, so to speak, within the very same site which he had occupied at the beginning of his literary career. In his old age, immensely experienced as he was, he had profited by everything, been changed by nothing. So, just as his religious position continued steadily to clear itself, without the necessity of any difficult reconsideration, in the same way his literary position never changed. And not only his fundamental beliefs about art, but also his more practical doctrines about poetry, served him reliably all his life, sparing him either the troubles of perplexity or the labour of steadfast self-examination.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_18_0	The basis of his critical practice, if he can be said to have had one, was empirical. For him the sufficient test of a work was whether or not it gave delight ; and, no absolute test of merit being of any use, a man’s judgment, which could only be exercised on the amount of pleasure given, would depend for its value on the nature of his artistic sensibility. His upholding of this idea almost amounts to an insistence on the distinction between the assessing and the explaining functions of the critic; though he is perhaps weakened by not recognising clearly enough that there may be different kinds, as well as different degrees of critical acuteness. If this is so, his touchstone was, first and foremost, the amount of his own pleasure derived from an unbiassed consideration of the object, before which his reason would “contribute willingly its assent, so far as it sees convenient.” But, owing to a quality sufficiently obvious in Dryden’s own character, his practice does not, at first sight, seem to agree with this contention.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_19_0	For just as he wrote in any form that presented itself, preferring one to another not so much because what he wished to say could better be embodied in it, as because his particular dexterity was better suited to the exploiting of the form itself; in the same way, although he was expert in arguing, the impulse to it came not from his desire for better understanding of difficult questions, but frankly from his enjoyment of that form of mental exercise. He was fond of making a case, but uninterested in independent analysis, and, characteristically, in actual argument he would depend rather on finding errors in his adversaries’ tactics than on attempting to overthrow their premises.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_20_0	This was made clear early in his career. For between the years 1663 and 1668 he carried on a leisurely pamphlet discussion, becoming rather embittered towards the end, with his brother-in-law, Sir Robert Howard. Rhyme was becoming fashionable on the stage; Dryden, a marvellously good hand at rhyming, applauded the fashion, while Sir Robert, having less facility, disliked it : both set to work gravely to dispute the question (almost an ethical one) whether it were right that rhyming verses should be admitted to the theatres. They employed various arguments. Dryden relied chiefly on the doctrine that blank verse is ‘‘ lower ” than the heroic couplet, and admittedly too low for a “ poem” (by which he meant an epic), or even for a “ copy of verses”: but tragedy is ‘by Aristotle, in the dispute betwixt the epic poesy and the dramatic, for many reasons, he there alleges, ranked above it”?; therefore, suitable as blank verse might be for comedy, for tragedy it could not fail to be too low. Sir Robert held the more British attitude that rhyme was unnatural in conversation, therefore absurd in a play : and even Lord Orrery’s use of it, with the “ greatness of its majesty ” and his “ particular happiness,” though it employed his wonder, yet failed to convince his reason. Neither of them, however, attempted to analyse either the real nature of rhyme itself, or that of the pleasure which, presumably, the audiences derived from it; although Sir
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_20_1	Robert bowed, after all, to that decision, by introducing rhymed passages into his own plays, which he did, he said, in order “not to appear singular, the danger of the vanity being greater than the error.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_21_0	In a good-humoured way, Dryden was prepared to do anything that fashion dictated. He would write the plays the public wanted, and use the critical arguments which the public endorsed as sound; but he did so neither from fear of diverging nor from a fundamental desire to be fashionable. For he had deep-seated instincts, and as soon as they were engaged, he dropped the formalities of coffee-house criticism, and, speaking boldly from his own emotions, he wrote such things as the Characters of Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, in the Essay on Dramatic Poesy, and of Chaucer in the later Preface to the Fables. ‘These are declarations of the freedom of the literary conscience, and in them there is no question of easygoing acceptance of the mode: he speaks from the heart; but whether he had a settled critical position remains still doubtful. Of Shakespeare— “ when he describes anything, you more than see it, you feel it too.” Of Chaucer— “ here is God’s plenty. We have our forefathers and our greatgrand-dames all before us as they were in Chaucer’s days.” The appeal is all to experience, and he carries his inquiries no further. For he would exercise his wit in pointing out what was to be expected from various authors (as in his comparison of Shakespeare, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Jonson): he would unhesitatingly sweep away received dogmas which conflicted with experience (as sometimes in his treatment of the ‘‘ Unities”) ; but he would never
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_21_1	put himself to the pains of initiating a research into the connection between works of art themselves and the emotions which they liberated in him.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_22_0	Words came easily to him. Once he had divined his thought, it can have taken him but little time to find the proper phrase to express it. In his later years, particularly, he has himself remarked the ease with which he composed, the only difficulty being to choose whether to “run” his thoughts into verse or to “ give them the other harmony of prose.” “ Thoughts,” he says, “ come thronging so fast upon me”—and indeed they did; so fast that, except when there was some definite obstacle to be removed or overcome, it was always invincibly easier to move on to the next thought which presented itself than to remain digging deeper about the roots of the last.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_23_0	“ Shakespeare . . . was the man who, of all modern and perhaps ancient poets, had the largest and most comprehensive soul. All the images of nature were still present to him.” This is from the Essay on Dramatic Poesy ; and thirty-two years later, in the Preface to the Fables, we find that Chaucer “ must have been a man of a most wonderful comprehensive nature. ... Not a single character has escaped him”; and so on, through the characters of both. Of both he speaks at once justly and enthusiastically, and neither Chaucer nor Shakespeare have so far received more noble praise. It may be praise critically conferred, but it is not criticism. For here, as everywhere else, Dryden does not probe into his subjects, either to analyse their methods or to deduce anything bearing generally on aesthetics. His object is nearly always one of two things: either to defend against objections, or to praise with discrimination. But the arguments brought forward for these purposes were at the end of his life chosen as dispassionately as in his youth, and almost as incautiously.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_24_0	In the passage on Chaucer his first business is to praise him: “ He is a perpetual fountain of good sense ; learned in all sciences; and, therefore, speaks properly on all subjects. As he knew what to say, so he knows also when to leave off; a continence which is practised by few writers, and scarcely by any of the ancients, excepting Virgil and Horace. One of our late great poets is sunk in his reputation, because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his way ; but swept, like a drag-net, great and small.” The modern writer was evidently Cowley. A page or two further on he wishes to answer some objections relating to his present work. It had been suggested that the Canterbury Tales were too poor and dry to be worth reviving: Cowley himself had thought so: “I dare not advance my opinion against the judgment of so great an author,” and “ sometimes also, though not often, he (Chaucer) runs riot, like Ovid, and knows not when he has said enough. But there are more great wits beside Chaucer, whose fault is their excess of conceits, and those ill sorted. An author is not to write all he can, but only all he ought.” In fact, whatever his object was, and however ardently pursued, he was always making a case, rather than trying to understand; so that for success he relied on the ingenuity of his invention more than on the rich fruits
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_24_1	of his study.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_25_0	That Dryden thought chiefly of the immediate practical advantage or entertainment to be derived from each piece of criticism as he wrote it, may diminish his absolute authority: it has nothing to do with the final value of any of his pronouncements, judged separately and on their merits. Indeed, it throws little light on the extent of his critical faculty : it only makes it difficult to decide just when that faculty is being seriously exercised, or to demonstrate just where his truest critical beliefs are to be found.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_26_0	For it is useless to make a selection of remarks on some point drawn here and there from his essays without a guarantee that it includes every single thing he ever said on that particular subject. By partial selection, there are few attitudes which could not be well illustrated, with a plausible implication that they were Dryden’s own: which might well, in a way, be true. But it follows that there are few questions upon which all his pronouncements agree with one another. To prove his freedom from imperfect ideas on morality and art, you may point to the Preface to the Indian Emperor, better known as the Defence of the Essay, and quote, “I am satisfied if it cause delight, for delight is the chief, if not the only end of poesy.” But if any weight is given to that, just as much must be allowed to the Preface to Tyrannic Love, written only two years later, in which he says, “I considered that pleasure was not the only end of poesy; and that even the instructions of morality were not so wholly the business of a poet, as that the precepts and examples of piety were to be omitted.” Similarly, in the Essay, when the discussion turns on the value of the Unities, Neander proves that their restrictions may be definitely harmful, and that reliance on them, as giving merit per se, is absurd ; but in the same year in which the Lssay was printed, he could
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_26_1	say, in the Preface to Secret Love, that the play was “ regular according to the strictest of dramatic laws: . .. a commendation which many of our poets now despise, and a beauty which our common audiences do not easily discern.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_27_0	In his writings you seldom find anything irrelevant : he thought too clearly for that, and sound reasoning was a necessity which he recognised gladly and continuously. He did not feel it equally incumbent on him to search very deeply for permanent principles underlying his permanent enthusiasms — for, after all, most of his tastes were undeniably enthusiastic and lasting. And for the rest, the argumentative, the theoretical, or the combative part of him — that all matured, and, in his later essays, to the brilliance and fire and lucidity of his earlier work there is added some touch of secure and unpresumptuous dignity, as though the consciousness of undisputed greatness, which old age, in spite of defeats in every other point, had brought him, had, in removing all temptation towards the self-assertiveness of his youth, made natural to him in the end an ampler modesty.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_28_0	This deepening of his character is shown up clearly by his behaviour in a wide-spreading controversy which took its course during the last three years of his life, and into which, as a younger man, he would certainly have plunged whole-heartedly, As it was, when Jeremy Collier let fly with his Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage, Dryden stood aside, ‘and left the business of a serious answer to the younger stage-poets, to Congreve, Durfey, and Sir John Vanbrugh ; who one and all did just as Dryden himself had done in less important circumstances, thirty years before : they spent their strength in denying particular applications, and never tried to understand what their accuser was really up to.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_29_0	Now Collier played very fair (a point noticed and admired by Lord Macaulay), in that he laid all his cards on the table, and, in the first chapter of his book, made clear both his intentions in the work, and the exact premises on which he was about to argue. The opening words are: “The business of Plays is to recommend Virtue, and discountenance Vice”; and a little lower, “ this design has been oddly pursued by the English Stage. Our poets write with a different view, and are gone into another interest... . Show, Musick, Action, and Rhetorick are moving Entertainments; and, rightly employ’d, would be very significant. But Force and Motion are Things indifferent, and the Use lies chiefly in the Application. These Advantages are now in the Enemie’s Hand, and under a very dangerous Management. Like Cannon seiz’d, they are pointed the wrong way.” Indeed the poets took intolerable liberties, “ viz. Their Smuttiness of Expression; their Swearing, Prophaneness, and Lewd Application of Scripture; ‘Their Abuse of the Clergy ; Their making their top Characters Libertines, and giving them Success in their Debauchery.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_30_0	This, then, was his quarrel with the poets; that they had not fulfilled the duties of their calling, but had wasted their time in profanity and smut. Then, if you believed that audiences must always find themselves irresistibly impelled to imitate whatever they see done or said (by whatever character) on the stage—if, in fact, the stage is a kind of mirror in which the spectators see an anticipation and forecast of themselves (for that was Collier’s view)—it follows that the players, who might so easily have led the town to virtue, were instead coldly teaching atheism and immorality. So Collier flung them down and stamped upon them, not for being bawdy themselves but for making others so. And their sins of omission were still greater: they rarely recommended virtue and were never found discountenancing vice.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_31_0	Thus, throughout the work, he never forgot that the stage was a kind of more efficacious pulpit. Obscenity or a jest at a parson are revolting at any time, but they naturally take on a further and more hideous importance when they usurp the very seat of instruction. He found a good example in Dryden’s opera, King Arthur, where we have “‘ Genii, and Angels, Cupids, Syrens, and Devils ; Venus and St. George, Pan and the Parson, the Hell of Heathenism and the Hell of Revelation ; a fit of smut, and then a jest about Original Sin.” Throughout the opera there is a sustained mixture of heathen mythology and Christian doctrine (“ this Mr. Dryden very religiously calls a Fairy Way of Writing ”) : Styx and Phlegethon are mentioned in the same breath as the actual devils of Tophet or the torments of the really damned. ‘Thus was the young libertine heartened and vice made bold and enterprising. But worse remained: the poet having “‘ diverted himself with the terrors of Christianity ” produced a so-called harvest-catch, in which one verse, sung by the harvesters, begins :—
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_32_0	We ha’ cheated the Parson, we’ll cheat him again, For why should a blockhead have one in ten ? For prating so long like a Booklearned Sot, Till pudding and dumpling burn to pot.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_33_0	“I don’t question but these four lines steal many a Pound in the year. Whether the Muse stands indictable or not, the Law must determine.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_34_0	The greater part of the book consists of charges like these, and he ranges wide and strong over the whole field of contemporary drama. At the end he sums up his case, and there again stress is laid not on the wickedness shown on the stage, but on that promoted in the audience. Not that he pretended to think that every single spectator fell a victim: “’tis a hard battle where none escapes.” But “ when the subject is agreeable, a lively Representation, and a passionate way of Expression, make wild work, and have a strange force upon the Blood and Temper.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_35_0	So there was his case: and, so far, it had been made consistently. But he went further. Having started by saying that the business of the drama was to instruct, he ended by condemning the stage to utter abolishment, and produced the Sense of Antiquity and the Testimony of the Fathers on the point. Clemens Alexandrinus found no name for the stage fitter than the “ Chair of Pestilence ” : Minutius Felix felt as strongly : Lactantius’ testimony showed that the subject of Comedy was the Debauching of Virgins, and the Amours of Strumpets : Chrysostom (to pass over St. Ambrose) found smutty songs more abominable than stench and ordure: Tertullian, St. Jerome, and St. Augustine left the matter in no doubt. The stage and all its players should be completely suppressed.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_36_0	The replies of Congreve and Vanbrugh were prompt and amusing, but ineffectual: from the outset they gave themselves away. Perhaps they felt themselves disarmed by a fact which Mr. Collier very well recognised, when he said, “ And, after all, the jest on’t is, these Men would make us believe their Design is Virtue and Reformation. In good time.” Anyhow, they argued against him with as little profundity as Dryden had against Sir Robert Howard, merely protesting that their writings were not so smutty after all. Dryden’s behaviour contrasted remarkably with theirs, and gives us as clear a glimpse, as we can now hope for, of his own feelings in his at last acknowledged literary supremacy.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_37_0	In the Preface to the Fables, and at the beginning of the story called Cymon and Iphigenia, he made, casually, some remarks which go nearer to answering Collier than anything of Congreve’s or Vanbrugh’s. “From immoral plays, to no plays,” he said, “ab abusu ad usum, non valet consequentia”’: thereby destroying the last part of his argument. And, for the rest, he contented himself with pointing out how strained were some of the examples quoted ; also how otiose the elucidations, from which he drew some effortless lines of satire:
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_38_0	The world will think that what we loosely write Though now arraign’d, he read with some delight ; Because he seems to chew the cud again When his broad comment makes the text too plain ; And teaches more in one explaining page Than all the double meanings of the stage. What needs he paraphrase on what we mean ? We were at worst but wanton ; he’s obscene.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_39_0	And he said no more about the matter, accounting for his silence by an admission that in many things he had been taxed justly : “ I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts and expressions of mine which can be truly argued of obscenity, profaneness, or immorality, and retract them.” Even he did not quite understand how the question stood.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_40_0	And as to the retaliations of his colleagues, it seems, from his own conduct, that he was less interested in their arguments than in their belief of Collier’s great importance ; since, for his own part, he thought all this business rather trivial; and came to that conclusion in a way remarkably characteristic of himself. Because he made, to some extent, a frank confession, it must must not be concluded that he felt himself unable to reply. ‘The fact is, he saw that the issue could not profitably be joined on that ground, while, in the proper sphere of contest, the truth or otherwise of Collier’s particular assertions was irrelevant. For he expressly stated that he expected his fellow-poets to make effective answer, “and neither they nor he could think Mr. Collier so formidable an enemy that they should shun him.” Now, if he had erred in his own plays, he knew that all the others were in the same plight. Others, not he alone, had “dilated upon the Argument of Love”; had “ treated it home,” and in the “ most tender and passionate manner imaginable”: others had written songs “ rampantly lewd and irreligious to a flaming excess”: others had “ put coarse usage upon the clergy.” Yet he expected them easily to make a victorious defence. Clearly, therefore, he perceived that such things as these, though the cataloguing of them formed the bulk of Collier’s book, were not themselves the essence of his subject.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_41_0	However, although ripe age and knowledge of the real value of his own achievements prevented him from descending into trivialities which did not concern him, he still did not trouble himself to penetrate deeper into the question. He felt certain of Collier’s futility, but did not take the further step which would have shown him that he was futile only in so far as the question was one of art: with which, in fact, he did not deal at all. That Dryden did not go so far as to formulate this, when he might so easily have done so, is much to be deplored, even though nothing that he could have written then would have altered immediate events. Jeremy Collier did not cause, nor could Dryden’s most noble arguments have prevented, the decline into which English drama was now to settle. Causes stronger than either of them were at work.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_42_0	Presumably, however, Dryden did not understand how different the world of London was becoming from that which he had known in his first days of authorship ; and, even if he had, he would have seen the hopelessness of attempting to stop change by reasonable arguments. He had heard and propounded such, without number, on questions of literature, but not one of them had ever influenced him decisively in the choice of any form or manner. ‘The necessity of earning money, and his own inclinations, had alone determined him: arguments had followed. He had always been satisfied with his tastes, and he remained so to the end of his life: the only © changes which he saw happening there were simple refinements, easily accounted for. Nothing could make him think that anything was bad which he admired ; and if anything he liked were attacked, he would think out for it a logical defence. Otherwise he was incurious about his own attachments, and also, therefore, about the nature of art itself.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_43_0	Accordingly, if one wishes to sum up his critical belief, one must first admit he had never consciously formulated one, or felt the need of doing so. Why he had been so incurious, why he had never wished to dissect his own artistic emotions, is a psychological question, depending on his character and the habits of the times. But we have a hint, in the combination which he displays of lack of originality with brilliant individual taste. His own emotions were too cleanly savoured to let him admit any partial or tendentious analysis, as he would have had to do in accepting any ready-made scheme: while his inability to originate (reinforced by his intellectual laziness) would have prevented him from evolving a system of his own. Perhaps, therefore, his incuriosity was in a sense deliberate, or half-consciously acquiesced in: certainly, for that very reason, he would have turned the more readily to that light and more or less conventional discussion which he excelled in, and into which he used now and again to drop, as though by accident, some idea which, though surrounded by superficialities, reveals him as a critic of superb resources.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_44_0	His arguments were often selected with but little deliberation ; but he was throughout consistent in the purposes for which he used them. He never really believed that rules were or could be binding on practice, and he felt that every work of art might, in a sense, create its own code by which it would exist and by which alone it could be judged. That is to say, that a critic must learn by study of a work itself, the rules which that work should (not necessarily does) obey; just as Aristotle, living in later times, would have framed his precepts differently.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_45_0	And, secondly, he recognised the necessity of maintaining, along with this independence of rules, a high standard of taste. He wished to be able to enjoy everything that was worth enjoying, and indeed there was wide catholicity in his powers of appreciation. But to secure such freedom of enjoyment, it is necessary to approach each fresh play or poem with no preconceived notions of what it is to be; and at the same time, to keep his standards at a proper level, the comprehensive critic must keep his reason and his fancy bright with the consciousness of all his previous reading. Only so can he be qualified not to lose himself when chance takes him into strange walks. It was, partly, knowledge of that fact which made so many people exalt the rules, thinking that in them they could find a substitute for patience and the lessons of experience.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_46_0	But Dryden would run no danger of maintaining his standard only at the cost of restricting the field over which he ranged. His highly cultivated and sober mind would check but would not hinder his imagination, which in turn inspired and moved but did not supersede the slower-moving reason. Each had in him, as in everyone, their parts to play, and they were mutually dependent. Reason by itself, he thought, is as immovyable as the other, unattached, is volatile: and he indicated very happily the ideal relationship between them, allowing that, though the imagination may sway the reason, the latter is in that case “a free-born subject, not a slave.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_47_0	Thus, he was more liberal in his literary ideas than the majority of his contemporaries. At least, he was better equipped than most to take full advantage of his opportunities, and to pass, with equal expectation of delight, through all the literature, classical, and modern, that was at his disposal. And as he was convinced that the private judgment was in the end the final test, for which it must be trained to use its own experience and be informed of that of others; so he thought that, though liberty brings with it to the mind a responsibility for which it must be educated, yet after all it remains liberty, and, as such, incompatible with any kind of restriction.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_48_0	Now this kind of critical freedom might seem to sit oddly with his religious and political conservatism: the more so, since it deepened as he himself grew older, and the mind, which was steadily moving towards Roman Catholicism on one side, was on the other abandoning more and more completely any conception of dogmatism or authority in letters. But, in fact, his literary and his political and religious beliefs are just counterparts to each other. “I may safely say, that conscience is the royalty and prerogative of every private man. He is absolute in his own breast, and accountable to no earthly power for that which passes only betwixt God and him. Those who are driven into the fold are, generally speaking, rather made hypocrites than converts.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_49_0	It is true that this, from the Preface to The Hind and the Panther, sprang from an exigency of the times, when the English Roman Catholics were requiring help from, of all people, the Dissenters. But, in substance, it was what he felt to be true. And certainly he was well aware of the difference between real religion, or real literary feeling, and the mere counterfeits of either, which are all that can be produced by cold adherence to rules, whether of Aristotle or of the Church.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_50_0	And for his political views, it must be remembered that Dryden, though an uncompromising Tory, had no faith in divine right, whether of kings or any other men. ‘To him it seemed that the king should reign and be obeyed not so much because revolution or disobedience were in themselves immoral, as because the appearance of such things indicated a state of affairs in which morality could no longer practically exist. Hobbes described civil disturbance and insurrection as “‘a return to confusion, and to the condition of a war of every man against every man, contrary to the end for which Monarchy had its first institution.” In which Dryden would have agreed, considering that revolution was either a surrender of everything that was civilised in the state, or else a confession of its emptiness: at the best it would be but a gamble on a losing hazard. His beliefs on monarchal absolutism and ecclesiastical authority were both arrived at coolly, and were held the more strongly for being based on temperate reasoning.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_51_0	And if he felt so about politics, it is natural that his literary ideas also should have been what they were. The scepticism which kept him from being either a Whig or a reactionary, prevented his running into any extreme views in letters. For instance, he had seemed at times rather to disparage or patronise his predecessors, glorifying the art of his own times at the expense of the Elizabethans. But he had never seriously thought so lightly of them ; and it was only because he demanded eagerly, for himself and his contemporaries, at least a fair hearing, that he occasionally went too far towards belittling the writers of the previous age. In his own time, he was especially taxed for doing so in the epilogue to the Conquest of Granada, where he had said :—
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_52_0	And, as their comedy, their love was mean; Except, by chance, in some one laboured scene, Which must atone for an ill-written play. They rose, but at their height could seldom stay. Fame then was cheap, and the first-comer sped ; And they have kept it since by being dead,—
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_53_0	and so on throughout the piece. But all that he really intended to do, was to insist that the modern plays should be allowed to stand or fall on their own merits, and not be condemned just for being unlike others, which were written in an age vastly different totheir own. “I would so maintain my opinion of the present age, as not to be wanting in my veneration for the past: I would ascribe to dead authors their just praise in those things wherein they havevexcelled us ; and in those wherein we contend with them for the pre-eminence, I would acknowledge our advantages to the age, and claim no victory from our wit.” And later, wishing that Congreve had the leisure to translate Homer, he spoke of him as living in a “ much better age than was the last. I mean for versification and the art of numbers; for in the drama we have not arrived to the pitch of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson.” Much as he detested the extravagance of “ companies of warm young men,” and those who would cry up anything new and fantastical, however contrary to reason, yet he would admit of no interference with the liberty of modern letters, provided it were used judiciously. Politically, monarchy seemed necessary in order to ensure : internal peace, which was in turn the necessary condition of productive life. In literature, too, the preservation of 4 continuity provided corresponding advantages, and helped authors to build on
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_53_1	the achievements of the past, provided that their study of the ancients did not dull them into mere imitators. St. Evremond expressed the most educated view of the proper use of antiquity when he said: ‘Ils formeront notre jugement, et le jugement réglera la disposition des choses présentes.” So much was particularly obvious to an age of experimental science, which would tolerate no ipse dixit in its poetry, any more than in its philosophy. Besides, to imitate the Elizabethans, in particular, was by Dryden’s time a hopeless task: as he said, “ There is scarce an humour, a character, or any kind of plot, which they have not used. . . . This, therefore, will be a good argument to us either not to write at all, or to attempt some other way. ‘There is no bays to be expected in their walks.”
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_54_0	But this is only speculation. Dryden’s practice provides the only evidence for the nature of his beliefs, and whatever form we may suppose for these, is only interesting, in so far as it can be referred back again to, and in turn illuminate, his work. And what I take to have been their most important effect on that, has already been indicated earlier in this essay. Freedom from literary dogmas combined in the most fortunate way imaginable with native qualities of his own, to prevent him from being hampered in his work by any divergence between principle and inclination. For the whole course of his thinking led him to the conviction that anything could become poetry in a poet’s hands—for so he thought, even though it was only his wish to defend his practice of taking ready-made plots for his plays that first made him express this clearly. Also, his lack of creative power, together with (what is partly the same thing) his laziness of mind, which was extensive, although Etherege would not allow that it was “‘ noble,” — all this kept him free from powerful impulses towards any particular forms or subjects: and he emphatically considered himself to be a poet. Therefore he had no artistic misgivings about the constructive possibilities of anything which his fancy might light upon, or, more often, which managers or publishers might ask for.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_55_0	Another consideration helped to make it easy for him to respond whole-heartedly to the demand of the moment. Like almost everyone of his time, he had no unduly exalted notions of the dignity of the poet’s calling. He professed only to delight the age in which he lived, and, in doing so, he never felt that he might be called upon for any sacrifice of artistic integrity. It is true that, before an injudicious audience, stuff might pass for good which, in his own eyes, did not correspond with the height of his powers ; so much he confesses, and blames himself for allowing it to happen. But in that event his fault lay not in undertaking the task, but in taking insufficient pains over it. He never quarrelled with the forms upon which he had to work: and he despised the crowd, not for the things which they demanded, but for being contented with such imperfect examples of them.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_56_0	Not that all forms came equally easily to him. He admitted that in comedy he never felt at ease. He was unfitted for it by what he called the “ sullenness of his humour,” and in general he disliked being “ the Sisyphus of the stage.” But in his complaints on that score, though there is regret, there is no bitterness. Vanity, naturally, would not let him be satisfied with a situation in which he saw himself being equalled, and even excelled, by men whose general powers he knew to be inferior to his own. In this he felt that he was unfortunate, but not that he was wronged: so that, for all his general regrets, his approach to each particular piece of work could be sufficiently serene.
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_57_0	This serenity was the immediate condition which made possible the production of just such works as Dryden’s. It enabled him to adopt an attitude towards his own writings that is at once intimate and detached: and without that combination he would not hold the place in English letters that he does. For he could identify himself with any form that was proposed to him, without ever becoming enslaved. The work that he did invariably left him more supple, and never imposed upon him any permanent bent: he never stiffened. And, as a result, he could use a wonderful diversity of forms, and genuinely exploit each one. Unhampered by habits formed in other ways of writing, he would approach a new mould, and at once seize upon the advantages peculiar to itself. And he never used his technical ability in a desire merely to excel or astonish: behind it and within it, there always existed, very vigorously, a simple affection, even devotion, for his art. And so, whatever he handled, since he used appropriate means, he was likely to improve ; and his sincerity teaching him to foster growth within, rather than to force by external pressure, his improvements were lasting and decisive. This is the reason why he offers no chances to parody. He never wrested his materials or buffeted them. And because they were treated gently and allowed to grow on their own natural lines, they display no extravagance or recurring mannerism. It is also the reason why, reviewing
1-9-character-dryden	doc_7_57_1	his own achievements, Dryden accounted for them as he did. He had seldom made any definite choice, and had never broken out in any clear originality. But in all the various fields of his activity he had moved with the same strength and grace, relying on the same instruments of prose and verse. He may not have attempted to say anything new. But inside the limits which he found he had undoubtedly created a harmony unknown before him. And although the language may not have acquired from him any quite fresh powers, he at least taught it a sounder economy, so that it could fulfil its functions with less effort, and, therefore, more graciously. Whether or not his ambition had always been, consciously, to do so, we may doubt: but his work, by itself, was enough to ensure that poetry alone should not go backward, at a time when, as he said, all other arts and sciences were advancing.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_0_0	THE STRUCTURE OF WUTHERING HEIGHTS’
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_1_0	By common consent Wuthering Heights is a remarkable book. I do not propose to discuss its literary merits, but to confine myself to the humbler task of investigating its structure, which presents certain peculiarities. Whether this is worth doing I do not know, but I found that it added to my interest in the book and made the tale much more vivid for me.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_2_0	The main theme is how a sort of human cuckoo, called Heathcliff, sets out with success to acquire all the property of two families, the Earnshaws and the Lintons. The tale is a fairly complicated one, and the incidents extend over a period of more than thirty years. Stated as baldly and shortly as I can, the plot is as follows: Mr and Mrs Earnshaw live at Wuthering Heights, a farm-house on a Yorkshire moor. They have two children, a son called Hindley and a daughter Catherine. One day Mr Earnshaw, who has been to Liverpool on business, brings home a waif he has picked up there. This waif, Heathcliff, is brought up at Wuthering Heights. Not long after, Mrs Earnshaw dies. Heathcliff is Mr Earnshaw’s favourite; he is also great friends with Catherine, but Hindley, who is older, bullies him, At last, Hindley is sent off to college. When Mr Earnshaw dies, Hindley returns for the funeral, bringing with him a young wife. He takes possession, ill-treats Heathcliff, thrusts him into the position of a mere servant, and allows him no more education. But Catherine and Heathcliff have remained great friends, and one Sunday they go for a walk, and out of curiosity look at Thrushcross Grange, a gentleman’s house in a park four miles off where Mr and Mrs Linton live. Catherine and Heathcliff peep in through the drawing-room window and see the two Linton children—Edgar and Isabella. The Lintons, hearing Heathcliff and Catherine and taking them for
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_2_1	robbers, let the bulldog loose on them; the dog seizes Catherine and hurts her ankle badly. She is taken in and looked after at Thrushcross Grange for five weeks, and returns to Wuthering Heights elegantly dressed. Heathcliff, who is very dirty and untidy, is ashamed. The next day the two Lintons come to dinner; Heathcliff behaves ill and is punished by Hindley. The next year Hindley’s wife gives birth to a son—Hareton. She, however, is consumptive and does not survive long. In despair at her death Hindley takes to drink. When Catherine is fifteen Edgar Linton proposes to her. She accepts him, feeling all the time that she is doing wrong because she loves Heathcliff. She tells Hareton’s nurse, Ellen Dean, about it; Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation, runs off and vanishes. Catherine is distracted by this, gets fever, and when convalescent goes to stay at Thrushcross Grange. Her host and hostess, and Mrs Linton, both catch the fever and die. This may be considered the end of the first stage of the story. The elder generation are all dead. The next generation are all alive — Hindley and Catherine at Wuthering Heights, Edgar and Isabella at Thrushcross Grange. Hindley’s wife is dead, but his son Hareton — the only representative of the third generation — is alive. Heathcliff has disappeared. His passion for Catherine and his revenge is the main theme of the root of the story.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_3_0	Catherine in due course marries Edgar and goes to live at Thrushcross Grange. After six months of happiness, Heathcliff, who has meanwhile mysteriously got some education and money, reappears. He sets himself to ruin Hindley, who gambles and drinks. He also finds that Isabella is in love with him, and decides to marry her to get her money. One day, after a violent scene between Heathcliff and Edgar, Catherine goes on hunger strike and gets brain fever. Isabella elopes with Heathcliff, who treats her abominably, and finally brings her back to Wuthering Heights. One Sunday while Edgar is at church, Heathcliff comes to see Catherine. ‘There is a passionate scene. That night Catherine gives birth to a daughter and dies. On the night after the funeral, Hindley tries to kill Heathcliff but is nearly killed by him. Isabella escapes from Wuthering Heights and goes to the South of England, where she gives birth to a sickly child named Linton Heathcliff. Soon after this Hindley dies of drink, and Heathcliff is left in possession of Wuthering Heights with Hareton, whom, out of revenge for the way he was treated as a boy, he brings up as a mere brute. At this stage there is a long gap in the story. Edgar’s daughter, who is also called Catherine, lives with him at Thrushcross Grange; Isabella’s son, Linton, lives in the South of England with her. Catherine is kept in ignorance of both her cousins Linton and Hareton.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_4_0	Edgar hears that Isabella is dying and goes to see her, Catherine in his absence goes to Penistone Crags, and in doing so has to pass Wuthering Heights, where she sees Hareton. On Isabella’s death, Edgar comes home with Linton, but Heathcliff claims him, and he is taken to Wuthering Heights. Catherine is not allowed by Edgar, her father, to go there. One day, after some time, Catherine on a walk meets Heathcliff and Hareton and goes to Wuthering Heights, where she sees her cousin, Linton. Catherine and Linton correspond secretly. The correspondence is detected and stopped. Catherine’s father, Edgar, becomes ill. Heathcliff meets Catherine and tells her that Linton is seriously ill. She goes to see him, and many times visits him secretly. One day, just before her father dies, she is kidnapped by Heathcliff and forced to marry Linton. Soon after Linton dies, having made a will leaving all his personal property to his father, Heathcliff. Heathcliff takes possession of Thrushcross Grange, and lets it to Mr Lockwood, who tells the story. But Heathcliff dies soon after, and Hareton and Catherine marry.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_5_0	How is a long story like this to be told? How is the reader’s interest to be excited? How is the tale to be kept together? How are we to be made to feel the lapse of time without being pestered by dates? How far did the authoress accurately visualise the ages of the characters in the different incidents, the topography, and so on? And how did Heathcliff succeed in getting the property? These are the questions I attempt to answer.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_6_0	The most obvious thing about the structure of the story which deals with three generations is the symmetry of the pedigree. Mr and Mrs Earnshaw at Wuthering Heights and Mr and Mrs Linton at Thrushcross Grange each have one son and one daughter. Mr Linton’s son marries Mr Earnshaw’s daughter, and their only child Catherine marries successively her two cousins—Mr Linton’s grandson and Mr Earnshaw’s grandson, See the following pedigree :—
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_7_0	In actual life I have never come across a pedigree of such absolute symmetry. I shall have to refer to this pedigree again later. It is a remarkable piece of symmetry in a tempestuous book.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_8_0	The method adopted to arouse the reader’s interest and to give vividness and reality to the tale is one which hag been used with great success by Joseph Conrad, But it requires great skill.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_9_0	After Edgar Linton’s death, Mr Lockwood, the Nnarrator, takes ‘Thrushcross Grange for a year. He goes to call on his landlord, Heathcliff, at Wuthering Heights, and is puzzled to find there a farouche young woman and an awkward boor. At first he supposes Catherine to be Heathcliff’s wife; when told she is his daughter-in-law, he then supposes that Hareton is Heathcliff’s son, and has again to be corrected. He, and the reader, are naturally puzzled at this strange trio. Lockwood calls again, and is forced to spend the night because of a heavy fall of snow. In his room he finds some books with the name Catherine Earnshaw and Catherine Linton, and a sort of diary of Catherine’s in a childish hand which gives a vivid , picture of the situation just after her father’s death. i Mr Lockwood has a nightmare in which Catherine’s spirit comes to the window, and he also witnesses a strange scene of Heathcliff imploring Catherine’s spirit. Our interest cannot fail now to be excited. What is this strange man and this strange menage? Who was this Catherine who died years before? What were her relations with Heathcliff? Naturally, Lockwood is much intrigued. On his way back next day he catches a chill and becomes ill. To pass the time he asks Ellen Dean, the housekeeper at Thrushcross Grange, what she knows about the family at Wuthering Heights. She, who was first Hareton’s nurse and then the younger Catherine’s, tells him the story of the
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_9_1	past thirty years in considerable detail. So that during the major part of the book Mr Lockwood is telling us what Ellen Dean told him, but sometimes, also, what Ellen Dean told him that someone else — for instance, Isabella — had told her. Only a small part, perhaps one-tenth of the book, consists of direct narrative by Lockwood from his own knowledge. But such a scheme may be confusing, and it is easy to muddle the time. Did Emily Brontë realise and let us know the dates when each event happened? She did, but not by giving them directly. Look again at the pedigree. The dates there have all been derived from the book, yet only one is directly stated. What first brought me to study the book more closely was when I noticed that the first word in the book was a date—1801. I thought this must have some significance. Similarly, the first word of Chapter XXXII is 1802. Apart from this, only one other date is given directly. In the last sentence of Chapter VII, Ellen Dean says, “I will be content to pass on to the next summer—the summer of 1778, that is, nearly twenty-three years ago.” This gives no further information, as 1801 is twenty-three years after 1778, but in the first sentence of the next chapter she tells us that Hareton was born in June. ‘This is how I get June 1778 for Hareton’s birth in the pedigree. But what about the rest of
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_9_2	the dates, not only those in the pedigree but of all the incidents in the story? There are a considerable number (perhaps nearly a hundred) indications of various kinds to help us—intervals of time, ages of characters, the months, the harvest moon, the last grouse, and so forth, and we learn, incidentally, that the younger Catherine’s birthday was on 2oth March. Sometimes, too, we know the day of the week — thus Ellen Dean will remember something which happened on a Sunday, or on a Christmas Eve. Taking all these indications, it is, I think, possible to ascertain the year, and, in most cases, the month of the year in which every event takes place—also the ages of the various characters, except, naturally, there is a slight doubt as to Heathcliff, because no one knows his exact age when he was found by Mr Earnshaw. But one has to 80 warily and consider all the indications together, for there is a curious subtlety that sometimes the characters are described as looking some ages which are not exact. Thus Lockwood when he first describes them says that Heathcliff was about forty and Catherine did not look seventeen. In fact, Catherine was seventeen and three-quarters and Heathcliff cannot have been more than thirty-eight. It would be too tedious to state the process by which I have discovered each date (see Appendix). But I will give one or two illustrations. We already know that Hareton was born in June 1778; we are told
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_9_3	that he was nearly five when Catherine Earnshaw married Edgar Linton, so that the marriage was before June 1783. But Heathcliff returned in September after they had been happily married for six months. Thus the marriage was in April 783. We are told that the scene that led to Catherine’s death was a Sunday in the March after Heathcliff’s return, and that her daughter, Catherine, was born about midnight, and the mother died two hours after. Later on we learn that Catherine’s birthday was the 20th (and that this was also treated as the day of her mother’s death). Hence Catherine died at 2 a.m. on Monday, 20th March 1784.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_10_0	I will give only one other instance. Lockwood begins his account in 1801; it is snowy weather, which might be in January or February or in November or December. But he returns in 1802 before his year’s tenancy is out. Hence the story begins at the end of 1801. A Michaelmas tenancy begins on the 10th October — not on 29th September — because when the calendar was reformed eleven days were left out. Therefore, the story begins after 10th October 1801. Now after Lockwood has been ill three weeks Heathcliff sends him some grouse, the last of the season. Since the Game Act, 1831, grouse may not be shot after 10th December, so we may take this as about the date for the last grouse. Thus the story begins about the middle of November, and this fits pretty well with the later indications. ‘That is sufficient to illustrate the process. Sometimes it is only by fitting together several indications, each rather vague, that one can find the month. There is, however, one curious fact. We can ascertain Hindley’s age. Now Ellen Dean was of the same age. She was his foster sister, and the doctor also refers to her as being of the same age as Hindley. Yet she makes two mistakes about her own age. Middle-aged people do, of course, make mistakes about their age, and these slips may have been intentional on the part of Emily Brontë, but, if so, it seems to me a little over-subtle.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_11_0	The topography is equally precise. On going from Thrushcross Grange to the village of Gimmerton a high-way branches off to the moor on the left. There is a stone pillar there. ‘Thrushcross Grange lies to the south-west, Gimmerton to the east, and Wuthering Heights to the north. The distance from Thrushcrogg Grange to Wuthering Heights is four miles, and Penistone Crags lie a mile and a half farther on. It was half an hour from Gimmerton to Thrushcross Grange.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_12_0	The botany is sure to be correct. Emily Brontë loved the country. I was a little surprised to find an ash tree in bud as early as 20th March, but then I realised that it was not on the moor but in the park at Thrushcross Grange, which lay low and was no doubt sheltered.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_13_0	I now come to the final problem. Heathcliff schemed to get all the property of both the Earnshaws and the Lintons. How did he do it? Emily Brontë clearly had a considerable knowledge of the law. We know the source of George Eliot’s use of a base fee for the plot of Felix Holt. We do not know the source of Jane Austen’s unerring grasp of the law of real property; but she lived among people who had settled estates and could easily have obtained it. But how Emily Brontë acquired her knowledge I cannot guess. ‘There is also this difficulty. Wuthering Heights was written in the eighteen-forties. It was published in 1847. But the period of the tale is from 1771 to 1803. The Inheritance Act of 1834, the Wills Act of 1837, and, I think, the Game Act of 1831, had changed the law. Did Emily Brontë apply the law at the time she wrote or that at the period of the tale? In one case, as we shall see, she used the earlier law.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_14_0	Novelists sometimes make their plots depend on the law and use legal terms. But they frequently make mistakes and sometimes are absurd as ‘Trollope is in Orley Farm. What is remarkable about Wuthering Heights is that the ten or twelve legal references are, I think, sufficient to enable us to ascertain the various legal processes by which Heathcliff obtained the property. It is not a simple matter. ‘There was a fundamental difference between the law of land (real property) and that of money and goods (personal property).
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_15_0	Let us begin with Wuthering Heights. The Earnshaws were farmers and not likely to have their estate settled. ‘The property had been in their family since 1500. We may take it then that Mr Earnshaw was owner in fee-simple, that is in effect absolute owner, of Wuthering Heights, and was not likely to have possessed any investments. It is more likely that there was a mortgage on the house and farm. On Mr Earnshaw’s death the land descended to Hindley as his heir-at-law. ‘There is no mention of a will. The personal property, which, probably, was only the farming stock and the furniture, would go equally to his children, Hindley and Catherine, subject to the payment of his debts out of it. On Catherine’s marriage Edgar would have become entitled to her personal property. Now Hindley drinks and gambles away all he has, and at his death the property is mortgaged up to the hilt. Heathcliff we find is the mortgagee. The personal property would also be liable to the debts. So that Heathcliff is mortgagee in possession and, for practical purposes, owner of all the Earnshaw property except any personalty that had gone to Catherine. This is all fairly simple; but it is more difficult when we come to the Linton property, ‘They were landed gentry ; they had a park, they had tenants. Mr Linton, and Edgar after him, was a magistrate. Such people, generally, had a settlement of their land, and we find, in fact, that Mr
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_15_1	Linton had settled it by his will. To understand what happens it is necessary to go into the intricacies of real property law and to look at the pedigree,
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_16_0	I must explain very shortly the law of entails, What is called an estate tail is an estate which descends according to the following rules: (1) Males are preferred to females; (2) males take in order according to seniority of birth, but females take equally; (3) descendants represent their ancestor. In case of a conflict between them, rule (3) prevails. A tenant in tail of full age in possession could by means of a fictitious action (for which a deed was substituted by the Fines and Recoveries Act, 1833) bar the entail and obtain the fee-simple, which practically amounts to absolute ownership. By his will a testator could settle his land on living persons for life, but could not give life estates to the children of such persons who were not alive at the testator’s death. Consequently, if he wanted to tie up his estate as long as possible, he gave life estates to such of his descendants as were living at his death, followed by estates tail to their children.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_17_0	Now the settlement made by Mr Linton’s will must have been as follows: The estate was devised to Edgar, his only son, for life, then to Edgar’s sonsin tail; Edgar’s daughters were passed over in favour of Mr Linton’s daughter, Isabella, who, presumably, had a life interest with remainder to her sons in tail. ‘This is the usual form. Thus on Edgar Linton’s death, Linton Heathcliff became tenant in tail in possession during the few weeks he survived his uncle. As a minor he could not bar the entail. It is most improbable that he had an estate in fee-simple; that would have been too unusual. Isabella might have had an estate tail instead of a life interest. This is most improbable, but if she did, her son, Linton Heathcliff, would have become tenant in tail by descent, so the result is the same. Heathcliff claims the property — by what right? Ellen Dean says that he claimed and kept the Thrushcross Grange estate in his wife’s right and in his son’s also. She adds: “I suppose, legally at any rate, Catherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.” She is quite right in her suspicions. Even if Isabella had had an estate tail, or even an estate in fee-simple, Heathcliff would not have had any tight as husband to an estate for life—the estate known as an estate by courtesy—because Isabella was never in possession. And even if, which to my mind is not possible, Linton Heathcliff
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_17_1	had had an estate in fee-simple, his father would not have been his heir before the Inheritance Act, 1833, because it was considered unnatural that an inheritance should ascend directly; and, as Ellen Dean knows and states, Linton Heathcliff as a minor could not dispose of his land by will. There is no difficulty as to the personal property. Whatever Isabella had Heathcliff got by marrying her. ‘There was no Married Women’s Property Act in these days. They eloped, so there was no question of a marriage settlement. Edgar Linton had saved out of his rents to make a provision for his daughter, Catherine. When dying he decides, in order to prevent Heathcliff getting at them, to alter his will so as to settle them on Catherine for life and then for her children. The attorney for whom he sends is, however, kept from going by Heathcliff, and Edgar dies before his will is altered, so the money passes to Catherine and then to her husband, Linton. He, though a minor, could (before the year 1838) make a will of personalty. He is induced or forced to do so, and leaves it all to Heathcliff,
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_18_0	Thus, at Heathcliff’s death, the position seems to be that he has acquired all the personal property of both families: he is mortgagee in possession of Wuthering Heights, and is, though wrongfully, in possession of Thrushcross Grange, which he has let to Lockwood. He thinks of making a will but does not do so. What then happens on his death? He has no relations, so that his real property will escheat, and his personal property will go to the Crown as bona vacantia. What then becomes of Hareton and Catherine who, when the tale ends, are to be happily married on New Year’s Day, 1803? At one time I thought this was the climax of the tragedy. These young people, ill-educated and incompetent, were to be left destitute. But that would be going too far. Catherine, as you will see from the pedigree, is the sole living descendant of Mr Linton. In some way or other, I need not go through the various alternatives, she must have become entitled to Thrushcross Grange, which is plainly by far the most valuable property. Heathcliff had been mortgagee in possession of Wuthering Heights for eighteen years, but this was not long enough to obtain an absolute title by adverse possession. Hareton, as Hindley’s heir, would be entitled to the equity of redemption. Now if Heathcliff, who managed well, properly accounted for his profits during the eighteen years as he could be made to do, it may well be that they were sufficient, if
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_18_1	he was charged a proper occupation rent, to pay off the mortgage. So that Hareton would get the house and land unincumbered or, at any rate, only slightly burdened. The personal property was comparatively unimportant, and we can only hope that the Crown did not insist on its rights, if it knew of them, or that if it did insist, the happy couple could buy out the Crown’s claim out of the rent which Lockwood, as we know, paid.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_19_0	There is, so far as I know, no other novel in the world which it is possible to subject to an analysis of the kind I have tried to make. This in itself makes the book very unusual. Did the authoress carry all the dates in her head, or did she work with a calendar? Was 20th March 1784, for example, on a Monday? According to my calculations it was not, it was a Saturday, but I should like to have this confirmed by some competent chronologist; for if I am right, it shows that Emily Brontë did not use a calendar, and that nothing will be gained by finding out, for instance, the date of Easter in 1803.
1-19-structure-wuthering	doc_8_20_0	However dull and technical the above details may be, they do, I believe, throw a light on the character of Emily Brontë and her book. German romances can hardly have been the source of her knowledge of English law. A great critic has spoken of the passionate chastity iets of the book; but the extreme care in realising the ages of the characters at the time of each incident which is described seems to me a more unusual characteristic of a novel. It demonstrates the vividness of the author’s imagination.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_0_0	I knew nothing of Henry James beyond the revelation of his novels and tales before the summer of 1907. Then, as I sat in a top-floor office near Whitehall one August morning, compiling a very full index to the Report of the Royal Commission on Coast Erosion, my ears were struck by the astonishing sound of passages from The Ambassadors being dictated to a young typist. Neglecting my Blue-book, I turned round to watch the operator ticking off sentences which seemed to be at least as much of a surprise to her as they were to me. When my bewilderment had broken into a question, I learnt that Henry James was on the point of coming back from Italy, that he had asked to be provided with an amanuensis, and that the lady at the typewriter was making acquaintance with his style. Without any hopeful design of supplanting her, I lodged an immediate petition that I might be allowed the next opportunity of filling the post, supposing she should ever abandon it. i was told, to my amazement, that 1 need not wait. The established candidate was not enthusiastic about the prospect before her, was even genuinely relieved to Sook in another direction. If 1 set about practising typewriting on a Remington machine at once, 1 could be interviewed by Henry James as soon as he arrived in London. Within an hour I had begun work on the typewriter. By the time he was ready to interview me, I could
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_0_1	tap out paragraphs of The Ambassadors at quite a fair speed.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_1_0	He asked no questions at that interview about my speed on a typewriter or about anything else. The friend to whom he had applied for an amanuensis had told him that I was sufficiently the right young woman for his purpose and he relied on her word. He had, at the best, little hope of any young woman beyond docility. We sat in armchairs on either side of a fireless grate while we observed each other. I suppose he found me harmless and I know that I found him overwhelming. He was much more massive than I had expected, much broader and stouter and stronger. I remembered that someone had told me he used to be taken for a sea-captain when he wore a beard, but it was clear that now, with the beard shaved away, he would hardly have passed for, say, an admiral, in spite of the keen grey eyes set in a face burned to a colourable sea-faring brown by the Italian sun. No successful naval officer could have afforded to keep that sensitive mobile mouth. After the interview I wondered what kind of impression one might have gained from a chance encounter in some such observation cell as a railway carriage. Would it have been possible to fit him confidently into any single category? He had reacted with so much success against both the American accent and the English manner that he seemed only doubtfully Anglo-Saxon. He might perhaps have been some species of disguised cardinal,
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_1_1	or even a Roman nobleman amusing himself by playing the part of a Sussex squire. The observer could at least have guessed that any part he chose to assume would be finely conceived and generously played, for his features were all cast in the classical mould of greatness. He might very well have been a merciful Cesar or a benevolent Napoleon, and a painter who worked at his portrait a year or two later was excusably reminded of so many illustrious makers of history that he declared it to be a hard task to isolate the individual character of the model. If the interview was overwhelming, it had hone of the usual awkwardness of such curious conversations, Instead of critical angles and disconcerting silences, there were only benign curves and ample reassurances, There was encouraging gaiety in an expanse of bright check waistcoat. He invited me to ask any questions I liked, but I had none to ask, I wanted nothing but to be allowed to go to Rye and work his typewriter, He was prepared, however, with his statements and, once I was seated opposite to him, the strong, slow stream of his deliberate speech played over me without ceasing. He had it on his mind to tell me the conditions of life and labour at Rye, and he unburdened himself fully, with numberless amplifications and qualifications but without any real break. It would be a dull business, he warned me, and I should probably find Rye a dull
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_1_2	place. He told me of rooms in Mermaid Street, “very simple, rustic and antique—but that is the case for everything near my house, and this particular little old house is very hear mine, and I know the good woman for kind and worthy and a convenient cook and in short—.” It was settled at once that I should take the rooms, that I should begin my duties in October.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_2_0	II
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_3_0	Since winter was approaching, Henry James had begun to use a panelled, green-painted room on the upper floor of Lamb House for his work. It was known simply as the green room. It had many advantages as a winter workroom, for it was small enough to be easily warmed and a wide south window caught all the morning sunshine. The window overhung the smooth, green lawn, shaded in summer by a mulberry tree, surrounded by roses and enclosed behind a tall, brick wall. It never failed to give the owner pleasure to look out of this window at his charming English garden where he could watch his English gardener digging the flower-beds or mowing the lawn or sweeping up fallen leaves, There was another window for the afternoon sun, looking towards Winchelsea and doubly glazed against the force of the westerly gales. Three high bookcases, two big writing-desks and an easy chair filled most of the space in the green room, but left enough clear floor for a restricted amount of the pacing exercise that was indispensable to literary composition. On summer days Henry James liked better to work in the large “garden room” which gave him a longer stretch for perambulation and a window overlooking the cobbled street that curved up the hill past his door. He liked to be able to relieve the tension of a difficult sentence by a glance down the street; he enjoyed hailing a passing friend or watching a motor-car pant up the sharp
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_3_1	little slope. The sight of one of these vehicles could be counted on to draw from him a vigorous outburst of amazement, admiration, or horror for the complications of an age that produced such efficient monsters for gobbling protective distance.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_4_0	The business of acting as a medium between the spoken and the typewritten word was at first as alarming as it was fascinating. The most handsome and expensive typewriters exercise as vicious an influence as any others over the spelling of the operator, and the new pattern of a Remington machine which I found installed offered a few additional problems. But Henry James’s patience during my struggles with that baffling mechanism was unfailing — he watched me helplessly, for he was one of the few men without the smallest pretension to the understanding of a machine — and he was as easy to spell from as an open dictionary. The experience of years had evidently taught him that it was not safe to leave any word of more than one syllable to luck. He took pains to pronounce every pronounce. able letter, he always spelt out words which the ear might confuse with others, and he never left a single punctuation mark unuttered, except sometimes that necessary point, the full stop. Occasionally, in a low “aside” he would interject a few words for the enlightenment of the amanuensis, adding, for instance, after spelling out “The Newcomes”, that the words were the title of a novel by one Thackeray.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_5_0	The practice of dictation was begun in the nineties. By 1907 it was a confirmed habit, its effects being easily recognisable in his style, which became more and more like free, involved, unanswered talk, “I know,” he once said to me, “that I’m too diffuse when I’m dictating.” But he found dictation not only an easier but a more inspiring method of composing than writing with his own hand, and he considered that the gain in expression more than compensated for any loss of concision. The spelling out of the words, the indication of commas, were scarcely felt as a drag on the movement of his thought. “It all seems,” he once explained, “to be so much more effectively and unceasingly pulled out of me in speech than in writing.” Indeed, at the time when I began to work for him, he had reached a stage at which the click of a Remington machine acted as a positive spur. He found it more difficult to compose to the music of any other make. During a fortnight when the Remington was out of order he dictated to an Oliver typewriter with evident discomfort, and he found it almost impossibly disconcerting to speak to something that made no responsive sound at all. Once or twice when he was ill and in bed I took down a note or two by hand, but asa rule he liked to have the typewriter moved into his bedroom for even the shortest letters. Yet there were
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_5_1	to the end certain kinds of work which he was obliged to do with a pen. Plays, if they were to be kept within the limits of possible performance, and short stories, if they were to remain within the bounds of publication in a monthly magazine, must be written by hand. He was well aware that the manual labour of writing was his best aid to a desired brevity. The plays — such a play as The Outcry, for instance — were copied straight from his manuscript, since he was too much afraid of “the murderous limits of the English theatre” to risk the temptation of dictation and embroidery. With the short stories he allowed himself a little more freedom, dictating them from his written draft and expanding them as he went to an extent which inevitably defeated his original purpose. It is almost literally true to say of the sheaf of tales collected in The Finer Grain that they were all written in response to a single request for a short story for Harper's Monthly Magazine. The length was to be about 5,000 words and each promising idea was cultivated in the optimistic belief that it would produce a flower too frail and small to demand any exhaustive treatment. But even under pressure of being written by hand, with dictated interpolations rigidly restricted, each in turn pushed out to lengths that no chopping could reduce to the word limit. The tale eventually printed was Crapy Cornelia, but, although it
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_5_2	was the shortest of the batch, it was thought too long to be published in one number and appeared in two sections, to the great annoyance of the author.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_6_0	Ill
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_7_0	The method adopted for full-length novels was very different. With a clear run of 100,000 words or more before him, Henry James always cherished the delusive expectation of being able to fit his theme quite easily between the covers of a volume. It was not until he was more than half way through that the problem of pace began to be embarrassing, At the beginning he had no questions of compression to attend to, and he “broke ground”, as he said, by talking to himself day by day about the characters and construction until the persons and their actions were vividly present to his inward eye. This soliloquy was of course recorded on the typewriter. He had from far back tended to dramatise all the material that life gave him, and he more and more prefigured his novels as staged performances, arranged in acts and scenes, with the characters making their observed entrances and exits. These scenes he worked out until he felt himself so thoroughly possessed of the action that he could begin on the dictation of the book itself — a process which has been incorrectly described by one critic as re-dictation from a rough draft. It was nothing of the kind. Owners of the volumes containing The Ivory Tower or The Sense of the Past have only to turn to the Notes printed at the end to see that the scenario dictated in advance contains practically none of the phrases used in the final work. The two
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_7_1	sets of Notes are a different and a much more interesting literary record than a mere draft. They are the framework set up for imagination to clothe with the spun web of life. But they are not bare framework. They are elaborate and abundant. They are the kind of exercise described in The Death of the Lion as “a great gossiping eloquent letter—the overflow into talk of an artist’s amorous design.” But the design was thus mapped out with the clear understanding that at a later stage and at closer quarters the subject might grow away from the plan. “In the intimacy of composition pre-noted proportions and arrangements do most uncommonly insist on making themselves different by shifts and variations, always improving, which impose themselves as one goes and keep the door open always to something more right and more related. It is subject to that constant possibility, all the while, that one does pre-note and tentatively sketch.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_8_0	The preliminary sketch was seldom consulted after the novel began to take permanent shape, but the same method of “talking out” was resorted to at difficult points of the narrative as it progressed, always for the sake of testing in advance the values of the persons involved in a given situation, so that their creator should ensure their right action both for the development of the drama and the truth of their relations to each other. The knowledge of all the conscious motives and concealments of his creatures, gained by unwearied observation of their attitudes behind the scenes, enabled Henry James to exhibit them with a final confidence that dispensed with explanations. Among certain stumbling blocks in the path of the perfect comprehension of his readers is their uneasy doubt of the sincerity of the conversational encounters recorded. Most novelists provide some clue to help their readers to distinguish truth from falsehood, and in the theatre, although husbands and wives may be deceived by lies, the audience is usually privy to the plot. But a study of the Notes to The Ivory Tower will make it clear that between the people created by Henry James lying is as frequent as among mortals and not any easier to detect.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_9_0	For the volumes of memories, A Small Boy and Others, Notes of a Son and Brother, and the uncompleted Middle Years, no preliminary work was needed. A straight dive into the past brought to the surface treasure after treasure, a wealth of material which became embarrassing. The earlier book was begun in 1911, after Henry James had returned from a year in the United States, where he had been called by his brother’s fatal illness. He had come back, after many seasons of country solitude, to his former love of the friendly London winter, and for the first few months after his return from America he lodged near the Reform Club and came to the old house in Chelsea where I was living and where he had taken a room for his work. It was a quiet room, long and narrow and rather dark — he used to speak of it as “my Chelsea cellar.” There he settled down to write what, as he outlined it to me, was to be a set of notes to his brother William’s early letters, prefaced by a brief account of the family into which they were both born. But an entire volume of memories was finished before bringing William to an age for writing letters, and A Small Boy came to a rather abrupt end as a result of the writer’s sudden decision that a break must be made at once if the flood of remembrance was not to drown his pious intention.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_10_0	It was extraordinarily easy for him to recover the past; he had always been sensitive to impressions and his mind was stored with records of exposure. All he had to do was to render his sense of those records as adequately as he could. Each morning, after reading over the pages written the day before, he would settle down in a chair for an hour or so of conscious effort. Then, lifted on a rising tide of inspiration, he would get up and pace up and down the room, sounding out the periods in tones of resonant assurance. At such times he was beyond reach of irrelevant sounds or sights. Hosts of cats—a tribe he usually routed with shouts of execration—might wail outside the window, phalanxes of motor-cars bearing dreaded visitors might hoot at the door. He heard nothing of them. The only thing that could arrest his progress was the escape of the word he wanted to use. When that had vanished he broke off the rhythmic pacing and made his way to a chimney-piece or book-case tall enough to support his elbows while he rested his head in his hands and audibly pursued the fugitive.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_11_0	IV
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_12_0	In the autumn of 1907, when I began to tap the Remington typewriter at Henry James’s dictation, he was engaged on the arduous task of preparing his Novels and Tales for the definitive New York edition, published in 1909. Since it was only between breakfast and luncheon that he undertook what he called “inventive” work, he gave the hours from half-past ten to half-past one to the composition of the prefaces which are so interesting a feature of the edition. In the evenings he read over again the work of former years, treating the printed pages like so many proof-sheets of extremely corrupt text. The revision was a task he had seen in advance as formidable. He had cultivated the habit of forgetting past achievements almost to the pitch of a sincere conviction that nothing he had written before about 1890 could come with any shred of credit through the ordeal of a critical inspection. On a morning when he was obliged to give time to the selection of a set of tales for a forthcoming volume, he confessed that the difficulty of selection was mainly the difficulty of reading them at all. “They seem,” he said, “so bad until I have read them that I can’t force myself to go through them except with a pen in my hand, altering as I go the crudities and ineptitudes that to my sense deform each page.” Unfamiliarity and adverse prejudice are rare advantages for a writer to bring to the task
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_12_1	of choosing among his works. For Henry James the prejudice might give way to half reluctant appreciation as the unfamiliarity passed into recognition, but it must be clear to every reader of the prefaces that he never lost the sense of being paternally responsible for two distinct families. For the earlier brood, acknowledged fruit of his alliance with Romance, he claimed indulgence on the ground of their youthful spontaneity, their confident assurance, their rather touching good faith. One catches echoes of a plea that these elderly youngsters may not be too closely compared, to their inevitable disadvantage, with the richly endowed, the carefully bred, the highly civilised and sensitised children of his second marriage, contracted with that wealthy bride, Experience. Attentive readers of the novels may perhaps find the distinction between these two groups less remarkable than it seemed to their writer. They may even wonder whether the second marriage was not rather a silver wedding, with the old romantic mistress cleverly disguised as a woman of the world. The different note was possibly due more to the substitution of dictation for pen and ink than to any profound change of heart. But whatever the reason, their author certainly found it necessary to spend a good deal of time working on the earlier tales before he considered them fit for appearance in the company of those composed later. Some members of the elder family he entirely cast off, not counting them worth the expense of completely new clothes. Others he
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_12_2	left in their place more from a necessary, though deprecated, respect for the declared taste of the reading public than because he loved them for their own sake. It would, for instance, have been difficult to exclude Daisy Miller from any representative collection of his work, yet the popularity of the tale had become almost a grievance. To be acclaimed as the author of Daisy Miller by persons blandly unconscious of The Wings of the Dove or The Golden Bowl was a reason among many for Henry James’s despair of intelligent comprehension. Confronted repeatedly with Daisy, he felt himself rather in the position of some grande dame who, with a jewel-case of sparkling diamonds, is constrained by her admirers always to appear in the simple string of moonstones worn at her first dance.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_13_0	From the moment he began to read over the earlier tales, he found himself involved in a highly practical examination of the scope and limits of permissible revision. Poets, as he pointed out, have often revised their verse with good effect. Why should the novelist not have equal license? The only sound reason for not altering anything is a conviction that it cannot be improved. It was Henry James's profound conviction that he could improve his early writing in nearly every sentence. Not to revise would have been to confess to a loss of faith in himself, and it was not likely that the writer who had fasted for forty years in the wilderness of British and American misconceptions without yielding a scrap of intellectual integrity to editorial or publishing tempters should have lost faith in himself. But he was well aware that the game of revision must be played with a due observance of the rules. He knew that no novelist can safely afford to repudiate his fundamental understanding with his readers that the tale he has to tell is at least as true as history and the figures he has set in motion at least as independently alive as the people we see in offices and motor-cars. He allowed himself few freedoms with any recorded appearances or actions, although occasionally the temptation to correct a false gesture, to make it “right”, was too strong to be resisted. We have a pleasant instance of this correction in the second
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_13_1	"version of “The American”. At her first appearance, the old Marquise de Bellegarde had acknowledged the introduction of Newman by returning his handshake “with a sort of British positiveness which reminded him that she was the daughter of the Earl of St. Dunstan’s."" In the later edition she behaves differently. “Newman came sufficiently near to the old lady by the fire to take in that she would offer him no handshake, . . . Madame de Bellegarde look ed hard at him and refused what she did refuse with a sort of British positiveness which reminded him that she was the daughter of the Earl of St, Dunstan's.” There were good reasons why the Marquise should have denied Newman a welcoming handshake. Her attitude throughout the book was to be consistently hostile and should never have been compromised by the significantly British grip. Yet it is almost shocking to see her snatching back her first card after playing it for so many years. She was to perform less credible actions than shaking hands with an innocent American, as her progenitor knew very well. He invited his readers, in the preface to The American, to observe the impossible behaviour of the noble Bellegarde family, but he realised that since they had been begotten in absurdity the Bellegardes could under no stress of revision achieve a very solid humanity. The best he could do for them was to let a faint consciousness flush the mind of Valentin, the only detached member of"
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_13_2	the family. In the first edition Valentin warned his friend of the Bellegarde pecuiarities with the easy good faith of the younger Henry James under the spell of the magic word “Europe”. “My mother is strange, my brother is strange, and I verily believe I am stranger than either. Old trees have queer cracks, old races have odd secrets.” To this statement he added in the revised version: “We're fit for a museum or a Balzac novel.” A comparable growth of ironic perception was allowed to Roderick Hudson, whose comment on Rowland’s admission of his heroically silent passion for Mary Garland, “It’s like something in a novel,” was altered to: “It’s like something in a bad novel.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_14_0	V
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_15_0	"But the legitimate business of revision was, for Henry James, neither substitution nor re-arrangement. It was the demonstration of values implicit in the earlier work, the retrieval of neglected opportunities for adequate “renderings”. “It was,"" as he explained in his final preface, “all sensibly, as if the clear matter being still there, even as a shining expanse of snow spread over a plain, my exploring tread, for application to it, had quite unlearned the old pace and found itself naturally falling into another, which might sometimes more or less agree with the original tracks, but might most often, or very nearly, break the surface at other places. What was thus predominantly interesting to note, at all events, was the high spontaneity of these deviations and differences, which became thus things not of choice but of immediate and perfect necessity: necessity to the end of dealing with the quantities in question at all.” On every page the act of re-reading became automatically one with the act of re-writing, and the revised parts are just “those rigid conditions of re-perusal, registered; so many close notes, as who should say, on the particular vision of the matter itself that experience had at last made the only possible one.” These are words written with the clear confidence of the artist who, in complete possession of his “faculties”, had no need to bother himself with doubts as to his ability to write better at the end of a lifetime of hard work and varied experience"
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_15_1	than at the beginning. He knew he could write better. His readers have not always agreed with his own view. They have denounced the multiplication of qualifying clauses, the imposition of a system of punctuation which, although rigid and orderly, occasionally fails to act as a guide to immediate comprehension of the writer’s intention, and the increasing passion for adverbial inter-positions, “Adjectives are the sugar of literature and adverbs the salt,” was Henry James’s reply to a criticism Which once came to his ears.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_16_0	It must be admitted that the case for the revised version relies on other merits than simplicity or elegance to make its claim good. It is not so smooth, nor so easy, nor, on the whole, so pretty as the older form. But it is nearly always richer and more alive. Abstractions give place to sharp definite images, loose vague phrases to close-locked significances. We can find a fair example of this in The Madonna of the Future, a tale first published in 1879, In the original version one of the sentences runs: “His professions, somehow, were all half professions, and his allusions to his work and circumstances left something dimly ambiguous in the background.” In the New York Edition this has become: “His professions were practically somehow, all masks and screens, and his personal allusions as to his ambiguous background mere wavings of the dim lantern.” In some passages it would be hard to deny a gain of beauty as well as of significance. There is, for instance, a sentence in the earlier account of Newman’s silent renunciation of his meditated revenge, in the Cathedral of Notre Dame: “He sat a long time; he heard far-away bells chiming off, at long intervals, to the rest of the world.” In the definitive edition of The American the passage has become: “He sat a long time; he heard far-away bells chiming off into space, at long intervals, the big bronze syllables of the Word.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_17_0	"A paragraph from Four Meetings, a tale worked over with extreme care, will give a fair idea of the general effect of the revision. It records a moment of the final Meeting, when the helplessly indignant narrator is watching poor Caroline ministering to the vulgar French cocotte who has imposed herself on the hospitality of the innocent little New Englander. ""At this moment,” runs the passage of 1879, ""Caroline Spencer came out of the house bearing a coffee pot on a little tray. I noticed that on her way from the door to the table she gave me a single quick vaguely appealing glance, 1 wondered what it signified; I felt that it signified a sort of half-frightened longing to know what, as a man of the world who had been in France, I thought of the Countess. It made me extremely uncomfortable. I could not tell her that the Countess was very possibly the runaway wife of a little hairdresser. I tried, suddenly, on the contrary, to show a high consideration for her.”"
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_18_0	The “particular vision” registered on re-perusal reveals states of mind much more definite than these wonderings and longings and vague appeals.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_19_0	“Our hostess moreover at this moment came out of the house, bearing a coffee-pot and three cups on a neat little tray. I took from her eyes, as she approached us, a brief but intense appeal—the mute expression, as I felt, conveyed in the hardest little look she had yet addressed me, of her longing to know what as a man of the world in general and of the French world in particular, I thought of these allied forces now so encamped on the stricken field of her life. I could only ‘act’, however, as they said at North Verona, quite impenetrably — only make no answering sign. I couldn’t intimate, much less could I frankly utter, my inward sense of the Countess’s probable past, with its measure of her virtue, value and accomplishments, and of the limits of the consideration to which she could properly pretend. I couldn’t give my friend a hint of how I myself personally ‘saw’ her interesting pensioner — whether as the runaway wife of a too-jealous hair-dresser or of a too-morose pastry-cook, say; whether as a very small bourgeoise, in fine, who had vitiated her case beyond patching up, or even some character of the nomadic sort, less edifying still, I couldn’t let in, by the jog of a shutter, as it were, a hard informing ray and then, washing my hands of the business, turn my back for ever. I could on the contrary but save the situation, my own at least, for
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_19_1	the moment, by pulling myself together with a master hand and appearing to ignore everything but that the dreadful person between us was a ‘grande dame’.””
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_20_0	Anyone genuinely interested in “the how and the whence and the why these intenser lights of experience come into being and insist on shining”, will find it a profitable exercise to read and compare the old and the new versions of any of the novels or tales first published during the ’seventies or ‘eighties. Such a reader will be qualified to decide for himself between the opinion of a bold young critic that “all the works have been subjected to a revision which in several cases, notably Daisy Miller and Four Meetings, amounts to their ruin,” and their writer's confidence that “I shouldn’t have breathed upon the old catastrophes and accidents, the old wounds and mutilations and disfigurements wholly in vain... . I have prayed that the finer air of the better form may sufficiently seem to hang about them and gild them over-—at least for readers, however few, at all curious of questions of air and form.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_21_0	VI
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_22_0	Explanatory prefaces and elaborate revisions, short stories and long memories, were far from being the complete tale of literary labour during the last eight years of Henry James's life. A new era for English drama was prophesied in 1907. Led by Miss Horniman, advocates of the repertory system were marching forward, capturing one by one the intellectual centres of the provinces. In London, repertory seasons were announced in two West-end theatres, Actor-managers began to ask for “non-commercial” plays and when their appeal reached Henry James it met with a quick response, The theatre had both allured and repelled him for many years, and he had already been the victim of a theatrical misadventure. His assertions that he wrote plays solely in the hope of making money should not, I think, be taken as the complete explanation of his dramas. _ It is pretty clear that he wrote plays because he wanted to write them, because he was convinced that his instinct for dramatic situations could find a happy’ outlet in plays, because writing for the stage is a game rich in precise rules and he delighted in the: multiplication of technical difficulties, and because he lived in circles more addicted to the intelligent criticism of plays than to the intelligent criticism of novels. |The plays. he wrote in the early “nineties are very careful exercises in technique. . .They are derived straight from the light comedies of the Parisian stage, with the difference that in the ’nineties,. for all their
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_22_1	advertised naughtiness, there were even stricter limits to the free representation of Parisian situations on English stages than there are to-day. In The Reprobate, a play successfully produced a few years ago by the Stage Society, the lady whose hair has changed from black to red and from red to gold is the centre of the drama, she holds the key to the position, but all her complicating effect depends upon the past — pasts being allowed on every stage comparative license of reference. The compromising evidence is all a matter of old photographs and letters, and the play loses in vividness whatever it may gain in respectability. Nobody knew better than the author that The Reprobate was not a good play. Terror of being cut forbade him to work on a subject of intrinsic importance. With another hour guaranteed, a playwright might attempt anything, but “he does not get his hour, and he will probably begin by missing his subject. He takes, in his dread of complication, a minor one, and it’s heavy odds that the minor one, with the habit of small natures, will prove thankless.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_23_0	Other early plays had been converted into novels or tales and so published. One of these, written originally for Miss Ellen Terry but never produced by her, had appeared as an incongruous companion to The Turn of the Screw in the volume entitled The Two Magics. A few attentive readers had seen the dramatic possibilities of Covering End, and when it was suggested to Henry James that he should convert it into a three-act comedy for production by Mr. Forbes Robertson (as he was then) and Miss Gertrude Elliot, he willingly consented. Flying under a new flag, as The High Bid, the play was produced in London in February, 1909, but only for a series of matinées, the prodigious success of The Passing of the Third Floor Back precluding the possibility of an evening for any other production under the same management. Under the inspiration of the repertory movement, other material was re-cast for acting. The Other House was re-dictated as a tragedy.. Owen Wingrave became The Saloon, a one-act play produced by Miss Gertrude Kingston in 1910. Finally an entirely new three-act comedy, The Outcry, was written round the highly topical subject of the sale of art treasures to rich Americans. It was not produced during: Henry James’s life. At the time when it should have been rehearsed he was ill and the production was postponed. On his recovery, he went to the United States for a year, and when he came back the day of repertory performances. had
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_23_1	died in a fresh night of stars.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_24_0	When The Outcry was given by the Stage Society in 1917, it was evident that the actors were embarrassed by their lines, for by 1909, when the play was written, the men and women of Henry James could talk only in the manner of their creator. His own speech, assisted by the practice of dictating, had by that time become so inveterately characteristic that his questions to a railway clerk about a ticket or to a fishmonger about a lobster, might easily be recognised as coined in the same mint as his addresses to the Academic Committee of the Royal Society of Literature. Apart from this difficulty of enunciating the lines, The Outcry has all the advantages over the earlier plays. “The characters are real and they act from adequate motives. The solution of the presented problem, which requires, like most of the author's solutions, a change of heart, is worked out with admirable art, without any use of the mechanical shifts and stage properties needed in The Reprobate. It is not very difficult to believe that if Henry James had been
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_25_0	encouraged twenty years earlier to go on writing plays
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_26_0	he might have made a name as a dramatist, but the faithful may be forgiven for rejoicing that the playwright was sacrificed to the novelist and critic.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_27_0	VII
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_28_0	Many men whose prime business is the art of writing find rest and refreshment in other occupations. They marry or they keep dogs, they play golf or bridge, they study Sanskrit or collect postage stamps. Except for a period of ownership of a dachshund, Henry James did none of these things. He lived a life consecrated to the service of a jealous, insatiable, and supremely rewarding goddess, and all his activities had essential reference to that service. He had a great belief in the virtues of air and exercise, and he was expert at making a walk of two or three miles last for as many hours by his habit of punctuating movement with frequent and prolonged halts for meditation or conversation. He liked the exhilaration of driving in a motor-car, which gave him, he said, “a sense of spiritual adventure.” He liked a communicative companion. Indeed the cultivation of friendships may be said to have been his sole recreation. To the very end of his life he was quick to recognise every chance of forming a friendly relation, swift to act on his recognition, and beautifully ready to protect and nourish the warm life of engendered affection, His letters, especially those written in his later years, are more than anything else great generous gestures of remembrance, gathering up and embracing his correspondents much as his talk would gather up his hearers and sweep them along on a rising flood of eloquence.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_29_0	But that fine capacity for forming and maintaining a “relation” worked, inevitably, within definite limits. He was obliged to create impassable barriers between himself and the rest of mankind before he could stretch out his eager hands over safe walls to beckon and to bless. He loved his friends, but he was condemned by the law of his being to keep clear of any really entangling net of human affection and exaction. His contacts had to be subordinate, or indeed ancillary, to the vocation he had followed with a single passion from the time when, as a small boy, he obtained a report from his tutor as showing no great aptitude for anything but a felicitous rendering of La Fontaine’s fables into English. Nothing could be allowed to interfere for long with the labour from which Henry James never rested, unless perhaps during sleep. When his “morning stint of inventive work” was over, he went forth to the renewed assault of the impressions that were always lying in wait for him, He was perpetually and mercilessly exposed, incessantly occupied with the task of assimilating his experience, freeing the pure workable metal from the base, remoulding it into new beauty with the aid of every device of his craft. He used his friends not, as some incompletely inspired artists do, as in themselves the material of his art, but as the sources of his material. He took ave thing they could give and he gave it back in his books. With
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_29_1	this constant preoccupation, it was natural that the people least interesting to him were the comparatively dumb. To be “inarticulate” was for him the cardinal social sin. [t amounted to a wilful witholding of treasures of alien experience. And if he could extract no satisfaction from contemplating the keepers of golden silence, he could gain little more from intercourse with the numerous persons he dismissed from his attention as “simple organisms.’ These he held to be mere waste of any writer’s time, and it was characteristic that his constant appreciation of the works of Mrs. Wharton was baffled by the popularity of Ethan Frome, because he considered that the gifted author had spent her labour on creatures too easily comprehensible to be worth her pains. He greatly preferred The Reef, where, as he said, “she deals with persons really fine and complicated.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_30_0	We might arrive at the same conclusion from a study of the prefaces to the New York Edition. More often than not, the initial idea for a tale came to Henry James through the medium of other people’s talk. From a welter of anecdote. he could unerringly pick out the living nucleus for a reconstructed and balanced work of art. His instinct for selection was admirable, and he could afford to let it range freely among a profusion of proffered subjects, secure that it would alight on the most promising. But he liked to have the subjects presented with a little artful discrimination, even in the first instance. He was dependent on conversation, but it must be educated and up to a point intelligent conversation. There is an early letter written from Italy in 1874, in which he complains of having hardly spoken to an Italian creature in nearly a year’s sojourn, “save washerwomen and waiters. This, you'll say, is my own stupidity,” he continues, “but granting this gladly, it proves that even a creature addicted as much to sentimentalising as I am over the whole mise en scéne of Italian life, doesn’t find an easy initiation into what lies behind it, Sometimes I am overwhelmed with the pitifulness of this absurd want of reciprocity between Italy itself and all my rhapsodies about had other wanderers might have found more of Italy in washerwomen and waiters, here guaranteed to be the true native article, than in all the nobility of
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_30_1	Rome or the Anglo-Americans of Venice, but that was not Henry James’s way. For him neither pearls nor diamonds fell from the lips of waiters and washerwomen, and princesses never walked in his world disguised as goosegirls.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_31_0	Friendships are maintained by the communication of speech and letters. Henry James was a voluminous letter-writer and exhaustively communicative in his talk upon every subject but one, his own work, which was his own real life. It was not because he was indifferent to what people thought of his books that he evaded discussion about them. He was always touched and pleased by any evidence that he had been intelligently read, but he never went a step out of his way to seek this assurance. He found it safest to assume that nobody read him, and he liked his friends none the worse for their incapacity. Meanwhile, the volumes of his published works — visible, palpable, readable proof of that unceasing travail of the creative spirit which was always labouring behind the barrier of his silence — piled themselves up year after year, to be dropped on to the tables of booksellers and pushed on to the shelves of libraries, to be bought and cherished by the faithful, ignored by the multitude, and treated as a test of mental endurance by the kind of person who organised the Browning Society. Fortunately for literature, Henry James did not lend himself to exploitation by any Jacobean Society. Instead of inventing riddles for prize students, he scattered about his pages a number of pregnant passages containing all the clues that are needed for keeping up with him. It was his theory that if readers didn’t keep up with him — as they admittedly
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_31_1	didn’t always—the fault was entirely in their failure of attention, There are revelations in his books, just as he declared them to be in the works of Neil Paraday. “Extract the Opinion, dis-engage the answer — these are the real acts of homage,”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_32_0	VIII
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_33_0	From his familiar correspondence we need not hope to extract as considered an opinion or as definite an answer as from the novels, but his letters are extraordinarily valuable as sidelights, helping us to see how it happened that any man was able to progress along so straight a path from one end of his life to another. The two volumes of memories are clear evidence of the kind of temperamental make-up with which Henry James was gifted, the two volumes of letters show how his life contributed to preserve and enhance his rare capacity for taking and keeping impressions. They show him too as unusually impervious to everything which is not an impression of visual images or a sense of a human situation. He was very little troubled by a number of ideas which press with an increasing weight upon the minds of most educated persons. Not until the outbreak of the great war was he moved to utter a forcible “opinion” about affairs outside his personal range. He was delightfully free from the common delusion that by grouping individuals in arbitrary classes and by twisting harmless adjectives into abstract nouns it is possible for us to think of more than one thing at a time and to conceive of qualities apart from their manifestation. What he saw he possessed; what he understood he criticised, but he never reckoned it to be any part of his business to sit in judgment on the deeds of men working in alien
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_33_1	material for inartistic ends, or to speculate about the nature of the universe or the conflict or reconciliation of science with religion. He could let Huxley and Gladstone, the combatant champions of Darwinism and orthodox theology, enrich the pages of a single letter Without any reference to their respective beliefs. “Huxley isa very genial, comfortable being . . . But of course my talk with him is mere amiable generalities.” Of Gladstone there is a little more, but again the personal impression is the thing sought. “I was glad of a chance to feel the ‘personality’ of a great political leader — or as G. is now thought here even, I think, by his partisans, ex-leader. That of Gladstone is very fascinating—his urbanity extreme—his eye that of a man of genius—and his apparent self-surrender to what he is talking of without a flaw. He made a great impression on me.” One would like to know what the subject was to which Gladstone had surrendered himself in his talk with this entranced young American, who must surely for his part, have been as much reduced conversationally to “mere amiable generalities” as on the occasion of his meeting Huxley. It is difficult to think of a single likely point of contact between the minds of Gladstone and Henry James. But that, for delicacy of registration, was an advantage. The recording instrument could perform its work without the hindrance of any distraction of attention from the man himself to the matter of his

1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_34_0	"His nationality saved Henry James from the common English necessity of taking a side in the political game; and in the United States nobody of his world had expected him to be interested in politics. There is a pleasant account in The Middle Years of his blankness when he was asked at a London breakfast-table for ""distinctness about General Grant's first cabinet, upon the formation of which the light of the newspaper happened then to beat.” The question was embarrassing, ""There were, it appeared, things of interest taking place in America, and I had had, in this absurd manner, to come to England to learn it : I had had over there on the ground itself no conception of any such matter— nothing of the smallest interest, by any perception of mine, as I suppose I. should still blush to recall, had taken place in America since the War.’’ Nothing of any great public interest, by any perception of his, was to take place in Europe until the outbreak of another War at that time far beyond the range of speculation. But if cabinets and parties and politics were and remained outside the pale of his sensibility, he was none the less charmed by the customs of a country where Members of Parliament and Civil Servants could meet together for a leisurely breakfast, thus striking “the exciting note of a social order in which everyone wasn’t hurled straight, with the momentum of rising, upon an office or a store.”"
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_35_0	IX
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_36_0	Henry James came to England to admire. But his early reverence for the men and women of an island with so fine and ancient a historic tone as Great Britain soon faded. He had forgotten, in the first passion of acquaintance, that the English are born afresh in every generation and are about as new as young Americans, differing from them chiefly in having other forms of domestic and ecclesiastical architecture and smoother lawns to take for granted. He looked at old stone castles and Tudor brick-work, at great hanging eaves and immemorial gardens, and then he looked at the heirs of this heritage and listened intently for their speech. This was disappointing, partly because they spoke so little. ‘I rarely remember,” he wrote when ke had lived through several London months, “to have heard on English lips any other intellectual verdict (no matter under what provocation) than this broad synthesis ‘so immensely clever.’ What exasperates you is not that they can’t say more but that they wouldn’t if they could.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_37_0	How different was this inarticulate world from the fine civilisation of Boston, from the cultivated circle that gathered round Charles Eliot Norton at Shady Hill. To that circle he appealed for sympathy, complaining that he was “sinking into dull British acceptance and conformity... I am losing my standard—my charming little standard that I used to think so high; my standard of wit, of grace, of good manners, of vivacity, of urbanity, of intelligence, of what makes an easy and natural style of intercourse! And this in consequence of having dined out during the past winter 107 times!” Great men, or at the least men with great names, swam into his ken and he condemned them. Ruskin was “weakness pure and simple.” In Paris he found that he could “easily—more than easily—see all round Flaubert intellectually.” A happy Sunday evening at Madame Viardot’s provoked a curious reflection on the capacity of celebrated Europeans to behave absurdly and the incapacity of celebrated Americans to indulge in similar antics. “It was both strange and sweet to see poor Turgenev acting charades of the most extravagant description, dressed out in old shawls, and masks, going on all fours etc. The charades are their usual Sunday evening occupation and the good faith with which Turgenev, at his age and with his glories, can go into them is a striking example of the truth of that spontaneity which Europeans have and we have not. Fancy Longfellow, Lowell, or Charles Norton doing the like and every Sunday
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_37_1	evening!
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_38_0	Whether or not all celebrated Americans behave with invariable decorum, the astonished spectator of Turgenev's performance had no temptation to “do the like.” His appearance among a company of artists and writers gathered together in a country village during the late summer of 1886 that been characteristically recorded by Mr. Edmund Gosse. “Henry James was the only sedate one of us all—benign, indulgent but grave, and not often unbending beyond a genial chuckle. . . It is remembered with what affability he wore a garland of flowers at a birthday feast, and even, nobly descending, took part one night in a cake-walk, But mostly, though not much our senior, he was serious, mildly avuncular, but very happy and unupbraiding.“
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_39_0	By that time Henry James was at his ease in England. The inhabitants were no longer either gods or imbeciles. Through the general British fog he had perceived gleams of intelligence shining on his bewilderment. He was no longer wholly dependent on Boston for refreshment. He could fall back upon the company of Mr. Edmund Gosse and he had found a friend in R. L. Stevenson. The little handful of Islanders possessed of a genuine interest in the art of letters and the criticism of life emerged from the obscurity, and he made out that, on the whole, there were perhaps about as many civilised people in England as in his native land. Yet he was a little troubled about his position. He wondered, while he reviewed the past, whether the path he had so carefully chosen for himself was the right one, whether he might not have missed more by leaving the United States than he had gained by coming to England. He lamented, in a letter written to his brother William in 1899, that he had not had the kind of early experience that might have attached him to his own country. He earnestly advised a different treatment for his nephews. “What I most of all feel, and in the light of it conjure you to keep doing for them, 18 their being a méme to contract local saturations and attachments in respect to their own great and glorious country, to learn, and strike roots into, its infinite
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_39_1	beaut ‘ as | suppose, and variety... Its being their ‘own’ will double their use of it.”
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_40_0	"It was only after a visit to America in 1904 that he found, on his return to Rye, that he had a home and a country. He was able after this discovery to write to Mrs. Wharton that “your only drawback is not having the homeliness and the inevitability and the happy limitation and the affluent poverty, of a Country of your Own (comme moi, par exemple!)""; and he could declare after taking the Oath of Allegiance to the King of England in 1915 that “I was really too associated before for any nominal change to matter. The process has only shown me what I virtually was—so that it’s rather disappointing in respect to acute sensation. I haven't any.” Associated he certainly was, allied by innumerable sympathies and affections to the adopted country. But he was never really English or American or even Cosmopolitan. And itis to difficult to suppose that even if he had passed all his youth in New England and contracted all the local saturations and attachments he urged for his nephews he could ever have melted comfortably into American uniformity. He, who took nothing in the world for granted, could surely never have taken New England for granted."
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_41_0	"To-day, with the complete record before us—the novels, criticisms, biographies, plays and letters—we can understand how little those international relations that engaged Henry James’s attention mattered to his genius. Wherever he might have lived and whatever human interactions he might have observed, he would in all probability have reached much the same conclusion that he arrived at by the way of America, France and England. When he walked out of the refuge of his study into the world and looked about him, he saw a place of torment, where creatures of prey perpetually thrust their claws into the quivering flesh of the doomed, defenceless children of light. He had the abiding comfort of an inner certainty (and perhaps he did bring that from New England) that the children of light had an eternal advantage ; he was aware to the finest fibre of his being that the “poor sensitive gentlemen"" he so numerously treated possessed a treasure that would outlast all the glittering paste of the world and the flesh ; he knew that nothing in life mattered compared with spiritual decency."
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_42_0	We may conclude that the nationalities of his betrayed and triumphant victims are not an important factor. They may equally well be innocent Americans maltreated by odious Europeans, refined Europeans fleeced by unscrupulous Americans, or young children of any race exposed to evil influences. The essential fact is that wherever he looked Henry James saw fineness apparently sacrificed to grossness, beauty to avarice, truth to a bold front. He realised how constantly the tenderness of growing life is at the mercy of personal tyranny and he hated the tyranny of persons over each other. His novels are a repeated exposure of this wickedness, a reiterated and passionate plea for the fullest freedom of development, unimperilled by reckless and barbarous stupidity.
1-3-henry-james-at-work	doc_9_43_0	He was himself most scrupulously careful not to exercise any tyrannical power over other people. The only advice he ever permitted himself to offer to a friend was a recommendation to “let your soul live”. Towards the end of his days his horror of interfering, or seeming to interfere, with the freedom of others became so overpowering that it was a misery for him to suspect that the plans of his friends might be made with reference to himself. Much as he enjoyed seeing them, he so disliked to think that they were undergoing the discomfort of voyages and railway journeys in order to be near him that he would gladly have prevented their start if he could, His Utopia was an anarchy where nobody would be responsible for any other human being but only for his own civilized character. His circle of friends will easily recall how finely Henry James had fitted himself to be a citizen of this commonwealth.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_0_0	Contemporary Techniques of Poetry
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_1_0	THE STATE OF THE PARTIES
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_2_0	We are now in the middle of one of those angrily disputed revisions of the Rules of Poetry which from time to time enliven literary history. No reconciliation seems in the least likely for a long time to come. The technical points of disagreement between the numerous rival factions, each of which will claim the true poetic succession for itself, are extremely varied, but may be classified under the following heads :—
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_3_0	Diction.—Particularly with regard to the definition of the word beauty, about which each faction makes its own violent claims; the legitimacy of, on the one hand, colloquialism, on the other, heroics.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_4_0	Metre.—The amount of variation allowed on a conventional pattern, the direction of that variation, the legitimacy of evolving new patterns, the legitimacy of doing without patterns at all.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_5_0	Rhyme.—Whether to be sanctioned at all in English poetry; its obligations, if so, to the sense of the poem; and the question of what may rhyme with what.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_6_0	Texture.—The relationship of vowels and consonants regarded as mere sounds; whether these sounds must always be melodious.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_7_0	Structure.-—What conventional connections must be maintained between the individual ideas, or between the groups of ideas that make up a poem; whether the connections should be predetermined; whether any connection is desirable at all.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_8_0	The rival factions can be conveniently discussed by a rough analogy from contemporary politics. Literature is by a popular figment unconcerned with politics; but that the analogy is not altogether forced can be seen at once by comparing the general run of verse printed and favourably reviewed in the Morning Post, say, with that printed and praised in, say, the Westminster Gazette. If recently there has been Left Wing poetry politely received by two leading weeklies, one Conservative, the other Liberal, this anomaly has been due to the literary editors being politically divorced from their journals. The poets of the Left Wing cannot rely even in such cases on any strong support, and have practically no press of their own ; that 1s probably why they remain the Left Wing. Mr Harold Monro of the Poetry Bookshop has befriended them occasionally in his series of Monthly Chapbooks ; and the Criterion and the Calendar are hospitable, but most of the more extreme work that they do is first published, if at all, in America.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_9_0	In this analogy I do not identify my Left Wing with the Parliamentary Labour Party, whichis always trembling on the verge of Liberalism, and is only kept Socialist, it seems sometimes, by the fact that the Liberal Party still survives and has a considerable party chest. The political Left Wingers corresponding with the poetic Left Wing are the groups who do not believe at all strongly in Parliamentary methods, though they have a few members sitting, and who label themselves Communist, Syndicalist, Anarchist, Non-co-operative, and so on; they are Third rather than Second Internationalists, include American poets in my analogy. If I quote their work it will be with apology ; for the history of American poetry is not to be compared with our own. Walt Whitman’s free verse has become classically legitimised, and it is no sign of particular rebelliousness to prefer his example to that of Longfellow. Miss Amy Lowell’s polyphonics, for instance, are almost haughtily traditional : if she were an Englishwoman she would certainly be writing in strict metres. I must also exclude the Irish poets, Messrs Yeats, James Stephens, “ ae” Russell, Padraic Colum, Oliver Gogarty, whose work cannot be put in terms of British politics : their literary maternity is Synge, Douglas Hyde, Darley, Moore, Sir Samuel Ferguson, James Clarence Mangan, the Anglo-Irish ballad writers, the medieval and ancient Irish bards, French poetry; the English paternity has had an equal share with this maternity, but let us avoid the traditional absurdity of only reckoning
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_9_1	a pedigree by the males. The Anglo-Welsh and Dialect Scottish schools must also be omitted ; the former, however, as might be expected, is Liberal, one might say almost Gladstonian-Liberal, and has affinity with the romantic-revivalist Ceiriog rather than with the academic bards; Scottish dialect poetry, though it includes the accomplished work of Violet Jacob, :5 bound to be Conservative, because English is the normal language of those who write it; the braw braes and the bricht burns and the prinking lassies have already a pleasantly archaistic ring about them.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_10_0	The Conservative first, in deference to his present predominance in Parliament: the alternative term Unionist ss also convenient to the analogy. He will deny that there is anything seriously wrong with the tradition of English verse that has its roots in Ovid, Vergil, Sophocles, and Homer, and whose poetic charter was drawn up by Aristotle. He will lay most stress on the more purely classical work of Jonson, Milton, Gray, Pope, Landor, the later Tennyson, Arnold, but will not deny a part in this tradition to former revolutionaries or liberals who, being securely dead, are unlikely to join the revolutionary or liberal parties of to-day : Shakespeare, the Romantic Revivalists, Swinburne, Browning, Rossetti. Of course, to legitimise the work is not necessarily to approve of the spirit in which it was written, and, therefore, the style of each of these poets is cut and dried as a classical model for younger poets to follow. Selected passages only; the “ roughnesses ”” explained away or boldly condemned, or weakly condoned as the licence of genius. Centenaries come round and bicentenaries and tercentenaries, and the celebrations are uniformly conducted by the Conservatives and the more barnacled Liberals, to the complete exclusion of the contemporary revolutionaries.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_11_0	The Conservatives are unanimous in believing in a God of Love who furthers human welfare, and who in a more particular sense confers material advantages on his spiritual and administrative representatives here on earth. While the social structure holds, there is Divine justice. Therefore, in poetry which represents this view, the Just, the Good, the Beautiful, though temporarily dimmed, must always have the last word : horror and pain must be overweighed by admiration and joy. Emotion (which is a dangerous quality in the ruling classes) must be under the strictest restraint. Squalor and filth must be kept out of sight. John Crowe Ransom is to the point here, writing as a Conservative who has lost confidence in his traditions :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_12_0	“When only moonbeams lit the dusk The world was somewhat set to right, For all the piteous twisted thin Had lost the crooked marks of spite Which seared the eyeballs to behold As man to man in broad daylight. But we forget so soon the shame, Conceiving sweetness where we can, H eaven the citadel itself Illumined on the lunar plan, And I, the chief of sinners, I The middlemost Victorian.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_13_0	But Mr Ransom is using “ mid-Victorian” in an emotional and not very accurate way ; though in the Gfties or ’sixties the comfortable classes controlled the Press and Parliament even more securely than they do now, there was always a hooligan and atheistic Left Wing which blasphemed the God of Love, and an intellectual Left-Centre which permitted itself occasionally to doubt.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_14_0	Before proceeding to a discussion of Liberalism and the Left Wing, I must make it clear that I am not airing any political grievances. I see no particular advantage in Conservative, Liberal, or Communist techniques on their own account. Great poetry — that is, poetry in which some people at any rate find breadth and intensity — will appear in each camp, but while political conflict persists will be unlikely to win even silent respect from the other camps. I am the historian merely; but having regard to the enormous dead-weight of prestige behind the Conservative view, and to the popular success of the Central Party, I shall possibly find myself making out the clearest case for the party which is least vocal, the Left Wing.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_15_0	This Left Wing is, of course, not a solid party, but a number of small groups loosely bound by a dislike of the Right and a scorn of the Centre; agreeing amiably to rebel, but not agreeing as to the ultimate direction of their rebelliousness. They include malcontents from the Centre and Right such as Messrs Herbert Palmer, Aldous Huxley, Robert Nichols, Frederick Branford, Miss Nancy Cunard, who have no great passion for revolution, and if the pinch came would defend no street barricades.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_16_0	Others who started as malcontents are now definitely committed to revolution, in which category Messrs T. S. Eliot, an American long resident in England, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell, Miss Edith Sitwell, Mr Ford Madox Hueffer, the doyen of the party, Mr Siegfried Sassoon, Mr Edgell Rickword, Miss Iris Tree may be found; there are, besides, born revolutionaries like Isaac Rosenberg ; and nihilists of the school of Gertrude Stein, who is an American Jewess living in Paris. The alien element on the extreme Left is predominant ; the Morning Post and the British Fascists, please note.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_17_0	As for the Central or Liberal Party, though Liberalism is politically in a sad way, “ by schisms rent asunder, by heresies distressed,” and without the confidence of the electorate, it dominates contemporary poetry, whether the test of sales or of newspaper publicity be applied, and for that reason the adjective “ Georgian,” which originally qualified E, M.’s biennial anthology of predominantly Liberal verse, has been popularly accepted as fairly representing all that is most hopeful in the poetry of this age. Moreover, Mr J. C. Squire, who recently stood as a Liberal candidate for Chiswick (having sloughed off his earlier Socialism), is popularly acknowledged the leading modern literary critic. I write without prejudice.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_18_0	Liberalism demands verse of a sweet-flavoured, wellmannered, highly polished kind; free from heroics and rant on the one hand, and from roughness and violence of expression on the other. Although more progressive in claim than the Conservatives, this Georgianism is more odious to the extremer Left Wing than the work of modern Tennysons and Arnolds. Being fairly successful financially, it is also consistently misrepresented by the Right-Wing critics who gibe at the “Georgian Xylophone,” lament the “ passing of the Grand Style and the noble theme,” and even identify Georgianism with LeftWing anarchy. Within its self-imposed limits (and both conservatism and Communism have limits too), Georgianism has many virtues ; a mediocritas often aurea (though even the gold standard is called in question by poetical economists), and as much genius as is covered by the definition about taking pains. Nobody who has not tried will know how much perseverance goes to making a verse like this of Mr Geoffrey Dearmer’s :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_19_0	“ The River dawdled silver-clean, A lane of mirrored sky, Through marsh and lawn of jewelled green, And restless fields of rye, Through haze and heat and round the feet Of meadow-sweet July.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_20_0	But the jealous tendency of both Left and Right is to attack the Centre where it is most vulnerable, the backbench group whose Liberalism is negative and vapid. Politically, it will be agreed that though the Left produces the greatest number of neurotics and rowdies, and though the Right has the largest proportion of solid dunces, one can count on the Centre for the greatest show of absolute sneffectives. ‘Their diet is neither roast beef and port nor crusts and tears, but, it is alleged, patent foods and lithia water. As in politics, so in poetics ; but this does not mean that Conservatism, Communism, and Liberalism can be identified respectively with Stupidity, Morbidity, and Vapidity.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_21_0	Here, then, is a rough statement of the parties, and poets are rare who do not acknowledge whips. Still one or two can be mentioned whose work is non-Parliamentary ; poets who have not had to cultivate poetic simplicity or strength, because simplicity is their birthright and strength ‘5 in their daily habit of life. In the elder generation, Mr Thomas Hardy; in the middle generation, Messrs W. H. Davies and Robert Frost (an American, but he has lived in England and first made his name here) ; in the younger generation, Frank Prewett, who, like Mr Frost, is a farmer. The strength of all these poets is apparently in the soil, and the soil is older than the Houses of Parliament.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_22_0	Mr De la Mare is difficult to classify : he began with a moderate Conservatism, but has since specialised in the poetry of Romantic Escape, which is rhythmically and imaginatively progressive, but conservative in diction : he is best described as an Independent Conservative, and has been honoured by the Conservative Party. Mr Ralph Hodgson has been similarly honoured, but he is not by , any means a poet of escape. He is a poet of pity, a | champion of the fatherless and distressed ; and his very idealism permits him still to remain loyally Conservative. Mr Lascelles Abercombie—who first won popular recognition in New Numbers, a poetry magazine of Liberal tendency, in company with Rupert Brooke and Messrs Gibson and Drinkwater—has given more thought to the fundamentals of poetic technique than any other living Englishman. He is an Independent, standing somewhere between the Centre and Left.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_23_0	Then there is Professor A. E. Housman. His Shropshire Lad was written thirty years ago, and has recently won grudging Conservative approval, like Tennyson’s Maud, which also was in its time Liberal in technique and Radical in the painfulness of its content. His Last Poems are chiefly interesting as a classicising of the technique and sentiments of 4 Shropshire Lad. He is another Independent Conservative, whose work will be text-book for the future: the proof of his Conservatism is that he has from time to time celebrated public occasions, the Queen’s Jubilee and the First Expeditionary Force’s glorious end, and that his work is rooted in the classics : the proofs of his independence are that his celebrations of public occasions have been unusual in conception and moving in expression, and that he is about the only English classical scholar with a great international reputation.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_24_0	There are no doubt other Independents of importance, but for the moment I cannot name them, and this essay does not claim to be an authoritative Who's Who of modern poetry.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_25_0	DICTION
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_26_0	In terms of the political analogy the question of diction calls for discussion first. The Conservatives have a dualistic rule that all words and phrases can be classified as either poetical or non-poetical. They will admit when pressed that many words have become poetical through redemption by divine genius, but the age of miracles is always over for the Conservative (until next time). The Left Wing believes that all words and phrases are equally suitable for poetry, with the exception of those particularly recommended by the Conservatives: these should be given a rest, they say, for another two hundred years or so. The Liberal, believing that poetic freedom slowly broadens down from precedent to precedent without necessarily the intervention of genuis, makes an occasional bold dash into the colloquial, obscene, or prosaic, and, as occasionally, slips into “thee ” and “ thou ” and the third person singular, present indicative, in “eth”; but the greater part of his time he must make, as it were, an embarrassed progress down modern Wardour Street, refusing the antique shops on the Right and the cinema offices on the Left.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_27_0	Take the question of flowers. A poet of the Right, Mr Reginald Cripps, in a light verse describing a villa garden, ends with:
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_28_0	“Indian cress, unknown to verse, And yet a glory : nought of grace Is wanting to this humble place.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_29_0	“ And yet a glory”: for Conservative poetry has a garden register in which are written those blooms of which tradition allows mention. At one time the rose, the lily, the pink, or gilliflower alone were permitted : but the sixteenth century added many, including a few wild varieties ; the Romantic Revivalists a few dozen more. Victorian gardening has made the register even less select : passion-flower, the gaudy melon-flower, clematis, the lesser celandine, cottage dahlias even. But Indian cress? No, not listed. Mr Cripps therefore pleads with Apollo, “ surely the omission is accidental ? ”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_30_0	"The Liberals would use Indian cress without apology, but self-consciously putting it in a bouquet of ""safe"" flowers like roses, buttercups, hollyhocks, pansies, avoiding chrysanthemum and delphinium because in doubt whether to give them a Latin or English plural. So,in Mr Humbert Wolfe’s Kensington Gardens he celebrates the roses, the tulips, the daffodils, and shows his Liberality by a single dashing reference to a sword-blue lupin."
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_31_0	The Left Wing will use any flowers it cares to use, from antirrhinum to zinnia. Stinking hellebore and squinancy wort will be in vogue, with the
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_32_0	“ Gold-freckled calceolarias, Marigolds, cinerarias, African marigolds, coarse frilled,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_33_0	of which Miss Sitwell writes. Where the question of grammatic construction arises, Conservatives permit certain well-established poetic inversions and distortions which the stiffness of the old prosody encourages : “ Sweet Muse, smile us upon—Our fears unceasing still—The blossoms ope until—Chasm on rugged chasm, hill upon smiling bill.” ‘The Left makes particular play with grammatic colloquialisms, false concords, omission of particles, false catenation, aposiopesis, with little interlarded phrases of French, German, Italian, Chinese, Volapuk, and béche-de-mer. The Centre keeps to a grammar a little removed above the vulgar, a little lower than the heroic; admirable in theory, but in practice usually embarrassing both to writer and reader.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_34_0	Here are a few illustrations from the work of the different parties to illustrate the diction favoured by them; in each case one apple from the middle of the barrel and one from the top (where apples are larger and rosier).
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_35_0	The Conservative first.—From the middle of the barrel I have chosen “ Queen Alexandra Day,” by R. C. Macfie, an LL.D. of Aberdeen. The universities and Scotland being the fortresses of the Conservative technique, and odes or ejaculations commemorative of royal events, declarations of war or peace, and similar public occasions being the chief exports of Conservatism, I flatter myself that the choice is a good one. The Left Wing, by the way, uses such public occasions for satiric purposes or complaint; the wise Liberal will not touch them. Perhaps if I had a copy of Poems on The Titanic Disaster (nearly two hundred of them, including one by Dr Macfie) or Poems on the Death of King Edward VII (over two hundred of these) I might get an even more suitable example. I do possess a volume of poems by eminent hands celebrating Britain’s righteous cause in the late Great War (one hundred pieces) and another of homage to Shakespeare at his Tercentenary (I have not dared to count the tributes), but these latter collections are not so representative as the first two of the “ poets’ corners ” in provincial newspapers. These corner poets form the real backbone of poetic Conservatism. Anyhow, Dr Macfie, thus : .
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_36_0	“ Mother-Queen ! Mother-Queen ! How hast thou heard, how hast thou seen Thy people’s woe ? Are there not golden bars between The high and low? How hast thou heard, how hast thou seen, How dost thou know ?
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_37_0	What can our lowly sorrow mean To one so high ? Though thou listen and though thou lean Down from the sky, Thou canst not tell our sorrow and teen Nor hear us sigh.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_38_0	Throned afar On a golden star How canst thou guess What sore distress And cold and hunger and weeping are? Were it not better to shut thine eyes To things beneath thee and far away.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_39_0	Why should’st thou listen for distant sighs ? 'Tis thine to praise and ’tis theirs to pray. Thou art a Queen by the Grace of God, And the height is high and the gulf is broad,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_40_0	which reminds me that E. M. has recently published a translation of La Fontaine’s Fables. A happy event. La Fontaine was a Liberal and poetically of cabinet rank; E. M. is most efficient as his English private secretary. In the fable about the “Smell of the Lion’s Den” (La Fontaine, VII, 7), where Bear and Monkey both suffer death though taking opposite lines of criticism :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_41_0	“ The Fox evaded a direct reply : He’d a bad cold and couldn’t smell, said he. That was the line to take—he went scot-free.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_42_0	Reader when to Court you go Avoid insipid flattery, As well as blunt sincerity, And never answer Yes or No.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_43_0	Blunt sincerity is the characteristic of the Left, as will be seen.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_44_0	Meanwhile, from the top of the barrel, a quotation from Mr Charles Doughty’s “‘ Adam Cast Forth,” a poem in the grand style which has had little popular recognition but which I, for one, admire sincerely and intensely. The speaker is Adama (Eve) who has just returned to Adam after a long separation; she has been fostered by a milch-camel :

1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_51_0	“ The little quids, the million quids, The everywhere, everything, always quids, The atoms of the Monoton— Each turned three essences where it stood And ground a gristy dust from its neighbours’ edges Until a powdery thoughtfall stormed in and out, The cerebration of a slippery quid enterprise. Each quid stirred. The united quids Waved through a sinuous decision.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_52_0	The quids, that had never done anything before But be, be, be, be, be, The quids resolved to predicate And dissipate in a little grammar. Oh, the Monoton didn’t care, For whatever they did— The Monoton’s contributing quids— The Monoton would always remain the same.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_53_0	A quid here and there gyrated in place-position, While many essential quids turned inside-out For the fun of it, And a few refused to be anything but Simple, unpredicated copulatives. Little by little, this commotion of quids, By threes, by tens, by casual millions, Squirming within the state of things— The metaphysical acrobats, The naked, immaterial quids— Turned inside on themselves And came out all dressed, Each similar quid of the inward same, Each similar quid dressed in a different way— The quids’ idea of a holiday.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_54_0	The quids could never tell what was happening. But the Monoton felt itself differently the same In its different parts. The silly quids upon their rambling exercise Never knew, could never tell What their pleasure was about, What their carnival was like, Being in, being in, being always in Where they never could get out Of the everywhere, everything, always in, To derive themselves from the Monoton.

Here, from the middle of the barrel, is Mr William Kerr’s “‘ Counting Sheep,” beginning :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_57_0	“ Half-awake I walked A dimly-seen sweet hawthorn lane Until sleep came ; I lingered at a gate and talked A little with a lonely lamb. He told me of the great still night, Of calm starlight, And of the lady moon, who’d stoop For a kiss sometimes : Of grass as soft as sleep, of rhymes The tired flowers sang ; The ageless April tales Of how, when sheep grew old, As their faith told, They went without a pang To far green fields where fall Perpetual streams that call To deathless nightingales.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_58_0	From the top of the barrel four stanzas from Mr Edmund Blunden’s “ Eclogue”’ :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_59_0	“ So talk ran on and turning like a lane Discovered meetings loved and left behind, And pleasure common once came peeping plain, A sunshine through the late mists of the mind, Leading these two to warm nigh unto song Upon the river where they dwelt so long.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_60_0	The ancient river flowing on among Sweet hop-grounds and their aisles of tasselled bines Old crooked orchards, fruit-plats straight and young— How gently to the sea his wave declines ! Vexed into whirlpools where the sluices roar, But in a field’s length easy as before.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_61_0	There the vole sunned him by the pollard’s heel, The pollard scored with tow-rope’s telling groove ; Far down the flood the singing bells would peal, The bells would peal, the silver swans would move Between the watermosses’ warm green beds, Where harmless fish could hide their simple heads.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_62_0	Now one thing is plain, that when Liberals get really passionately excited or pleased or angered by any poetic thought their Liberalism vanishes. Even in the passage I have just quoted from Mr Blunden there is a tendency to revert to Conservatism, to “ warm nigh unto song” in the traditionalsense. Mr Edward Shanks, in his very fine “Woman’s Song,” similarly uses “thou” and “ thee” and “thine” in preference to “you ” and “you” and “yours” ; the emotion is too keen for the conversational tone. Politically the analogy holds good. When stones and brickbats are thrown and truncheons drawn, the Liberal usually runs to the assistance or the protection of the truncheons ; only occasionally he turns up his coat collar to hide a starched shirt and flings brickbats with the leaders of the mob. Obviously he can’t stay where he is between the conflicting parties.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_63_0	Extreme anarchy is represented by Miss Gertrude Stein, author of Tender Buttons, Three Lives, Geography and Plays. ‘The following is the poetic geography of Americans as she sees them: It has occasional “cadence,” and uses rthythmic repetition as its chief ornament. I have selected one of the least complex passages. I must confess that I have great respect for this work; it is nonsense, but only according to a narrow classification of sense. To disregard it is not altogether a sign of mental strength and activity :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_64_0	“A legal pencil, a really legal pencil, is incredible, it fastens the whole strong iron wire calendar. “ An inherent investigation, does that mean murder or does it only mean a railroad track with plenty of cinders ? “ Words that cumber nothing and call exceptionally tall people from very far away are those that have the same center as those used by them frequently. A soap, a whole soap, any piece of a whole soap, more whole soap and not mistily, all this is no outrage and no blessing. A precious thing is an oily thing. In that there is no sugar and silence. “The thread, the thread, the thread is the language of yesterday, it is the resolution of to-day, it is no pain. “Pin in and pin in and point clear and point where. Breakfast, breakfast is the arrangement that beggars corn, that shows the habit of fishes, that powders aches and stumblings, and any useful thing. The way to say it, is to say it.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_65_0	And certainly Miss Stein says it and says it sincerely.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_66_0	METRE
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_67_0	It will be found interesting to compare the treatment of metre by the different poetic factions with the attitude of the various political factions to the community. Metre considered as a set pattern approved by convention will stand for the claims of society as at present organised : the variations on metre will stand for the claims of the individual. Conservatism stands for a jealous maintenance of metre in its strictest Victorian usage, though there will be a Die-hard Right which will deny that even the present structure of metre is adequate and will wish to revert to the eighteenth century Augustan style or even a primitive classicism of hexameters and quantitative scansion.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_68_0	The Left Wing — Some members of the Left, perhaps the greater number of them, do admit their share for better or worse in the community, but their criticism of existing abuses in administration and their claims for greater personal liberty threaten to swamp the claims of the community altogether.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_69_0	Others of the Left, by rejecting customary forms and inventing rather foggy new patterns of their own which they call “ cadences,” are politically of the type branded by their enemies as vague idealists or Utopians. Messrs Aldington and Flint are of this party. Mr Flint has written, ‘“‘ Metre is used by most ‘ modern’ poets because it provides them with a framework of rhythm on which to hang their words. . .. A certain amount of craftsmanship only is needed to fill up a metre; but only a true artist can make a rhythm that will please our ears for its own sake.” Extremes of Left and Right frequently meet, as will have been noticed in the clipping of grammar, the use of unusual words, and as will again be noticed in the rejection of rhyme. To the Left of these Utopians again are the Anarchists, who use no pattern at all, nor even trouble to keep a cadence going. In their extremest moods, their poetry is a broken series of sounds less regular than the noises made by the wind, mice, traffic, or the hot-water cistern. Miss Stein’s “ A Sweet Tail” ends :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_70_0	“It is so thick and thin and thin, it is thick. It is thick, thin A spoon, thick ahead and matches, matches wear sacks, Stew, stew, than.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_71_0	As flowers were a good test of rival theories of diction, so blank verse as used by the different parties provides interesting comparisons in the use of metre.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_72_0	With the Conservative the prosody is always that of the five iambic feet and the cesura, that can only have three, I think, legitimate places. Variations are only permitted in the case of awkwardly scanning proper names, or occasional moments of passion or dramatic pause, or heavy humour. The extra syllable at the end is forbidden by many, by others permitted only as an occasional licence to register emotion or vary monotony. Its frequent use is regarded as a decadence. The Liberal seldom uses the form, but when he does, justifies his greater variation, occasional trochees, dactyls, or anapests instead of iambs, and frequent feminine endings, by Shakespeare’s later tragedies.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_73_0	The Left Wing may do almost anything to blank verse, and does. ‘The way to do it, is to do it. Here is a passage from Isaac Rosenberg’s Moses, a poetic play of importance :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_74_0	“ Pharaoh will speak, and I’ll seize that word to act, Should the word be a foe’s, I can use it well As a poison to soak into Egypt’s bowels, A wraith from Old Nile will cry ‘For his mercy they break his back,’ And I shall have a great following for this The rude touched heart of the mauled sweaty horde, Their rough tongues fawn at my hands, their red streaked eyes Glitter with sacrifice. Well! Pharaoh bids me act, Hah! I’m all abristle. Lord! his eyes would go wide If he knew the road my rampant dreams would race; I am too much awake now—restless, so restless.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_75_0	And here one from Mr Sacheverell Sitwell’s Actor Rehearsing :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_76_0	“ A bed, a chair, a table, and a cupboard Stand in this bare room and rattle at my tread. Save for these and a mirror is my room quite bare ; It is empty like a honeycomb that holds no honey, For the sun never comes to load my cell with light. The paper that strips itself from off my walls Is canvas dropped away and rotting from its scaffolding :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_77_0	My moonlight tempered with black smoke— The magnesium lights that groan before each flare- It is too dark for reflections to play upon the walls. So I have no gilded lattices against my bruised plaster, My window-panes, like broken mirrors, Showing me no starlight, that wood of golden trees— I’m left with nothing, with bare boards and rain-soaked ceiling. . . .”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_78_0	Varied beyond this point, blank verse is no longer blank verse, but, I suppose, “cadence.” One of the characteristics of the Left is its insistence that patterns can not only be varied almost to disappearing point but changed and broken off jaggedly wherever necessary
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_79_0	So Mr Eliot in The Waste Land:
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_80_0	“While I was fishing in the dull canal On a winter evening round behind the gas-house, Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck , And on the king my father’s death before him, White bodies naked on the low damp ground, And bones cast in a little low dry garret, Rattled by the rat’s foot only year to year. But at my back from time to time I hear The sounds of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright on Mrs Porter And on her daughter, They wash their feet in soda water, Et oh! ces voix d’enfants, chantant dans la cupole !

1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_82_0	The claim of the Left is that the basis of poetic rhythm being music, the two arts should be kept abreast ; that Conservative poetry corresponds with a system of music now completely antiquated ; that all attempts to make English prosody conform with classical prosody (even allowing accent to take the place of quantity) are against nature.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_83_0	The Conservative view is best given in quotation from the writings of a critic who was not only a great scholar in his day, and a Scot, but actually a crowned head : from King James VI’s Reulis and Cautelis to be Observit and Eschewtt :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_84_0	“ First, ye maun understand that all syllabis are devydit in three kindes: That is, some schort, some lang, and some indifferent. Be indifferent I meane they quhilk are ather lang or schort, according as ye place thame.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_85_0	“ The forme of placeing syllabis in verse is this : That your first syllabe in the lyne be schort, the second lang, the third schort, the fourt lang, the fyft schort, the sixt lang, and sa furth to the end of the lyne. Alwayis tak heid that the nomber of your fete in every lyne be evin and nocht odde. . . . Bot gif ye wald ask me the reulis quhairby to knaw everie ane of thir thre foirsaidis kyndes of syllabis, | answer, your ear maun be the onely judge and discerner thereof.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_86_0	The Left objects on principle to this rigid dualism of “‘ather lang or schort,” and asks for poetry a rhythmic freedom as great as the modern musician’s.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_87_0	The Liberals whose genius is practical and administrative will in this as in all other conflicts stand between the combatants with the customary appeal to common sense: “Why quarrel? Let us arbitrate. The English genius lies in compromise. Let us gradually introduce this new revolutionary wine into the Conservative bottles ; but very gradually, very gradually ; indeed, drop by drop, so that by the time the bottles are filled the wine will have become far less lively.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_88_0	TEXTURE
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_89_0	The Conservatives pay a good deal of attention to texture. The aim is euphony and, within the strict forms favoured, variety. The term “ texture” covers the relations of a poem’s vowels and consonants, other than rhymes, considered as mere sound, and supplementing the rhythm and images. It will in a Conservative sense include the variation of internal vowel-sounds to give an effect of richness ; the use, perhaps, of liquid consonants and labials and open vowels to give smoothness, of aspirate and dentals to give force, of gutturals to give strength; the careful use of sibilants, which are to texture what salt is to food. It will include the use of alliteration, not with the barbarous recurrence of Piers Plowman but decorously to intensify any required mood or quality: alliteration in the hands of the craftsmen will be concealed or chiasmic unless the effect intended is heroic. It will include the variation of word-endings, with particular watch on the present participle and adjectives formed in terminal y: care for the convenience of the reader lest words ending in a consonant be too frequently followed by other words beginning with the same or a closely related consonant (as “ break ground,” “ stoop below ” ; “ maid’s sorrow,” “ great toe”), where a slight delay in the line’s even flow is each time occasioned by the guttural or palatal change of gear. If these technical considerations interest the more learned and accomplished of the Conservatives, they are of even
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_89_1	greater interest to the Liberals, one of whose main virtues is, as I have said, their practical administrative ability. As a party they probably give more conscious attention to the details of technique than the Conservatives, who are usually content wherever a difficulty appears, to ride off on the privilege of a distortion or inversion.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_90_0	The Left Wing either eschews all thought of texture as being another of these heavy chains clamped on the naked limbs of poetry, or uses its knowledge of the art to its own ends—sometimes in the orthodox manner, but oftener as enemies of the Church practise black magic, by a travesty of gospel and psalm and the Lord’s Prayer said backwards. By judicious manipulation of vowels and consonants, a line can be made to limp, to crawl, to scream, to bellow, to make other ugly or sickly noises.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_91_0	In the second line of the following from The Waste Land Mr Eliot makes a realistic snuffle :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_92_0	“ Madam Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, Had a bad cold, nevertheless : Was known to be the wisest woman in Europe,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_93_0	and he even leaves an interval in the blank verse line for the nose to be blown.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_94_0	Mr Siegfried Sassoon in Ancient History (I quote the first version of the piece) writes :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_95_0	“he thought of Abel, soft and fair, A lover with disaster in his face, And scarlet berries twisted in his hair,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_96_0	where the sense of Abel’s weakness is conveyed by the similar terminations of “lover” and “ disaster” and by the succession of short vowels in the last line. The contrast is with
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_97_0	“He was the grandest of them all, was Cain ! A lion laired in the hills whom none might tire, Swift as a stag, a stallion of the plain, Hungry and fierce with deeds of huge desire,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_98_0	Mr D. H. Lawrence, in his description of the bat circling in daylight round his room and refusing to be driven out of the window, writes :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_99_0	"""Go! but he will not... Round and round and round In an impure haste, Fumbling, a beast in air, And stumbling, lunging, and touching the walls, the bell-wires, About my room.”"
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_100_0	These four present participles in short u not only suggest the bat’s clumsiness in failing to find a way out, but the sense of his own awkwardness and giddiness as he pursues 1t.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_101_0	An American, Mr Vachel Lindsay, whose poems are primarily written for recitation, is, perhaps, the greatest modern exponent of the art of making suitable noises in verse. In the following passage from The Congo the sense of hollow-sounding rhythmic percussion is given as nowhere else in English poetry :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_102_0	“Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room, Barrel-house kings, with feet unstable, Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table, Pounded on the table, Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom Hard as they were able, Boom, boom, BOOM, With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom, Boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, BOOM.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_103_0	The percussion is chiefly given by the syncopation, the stressed syllables being detained by a rest, so that they come out extra heavily when they do come. But the syncopation is supplemented by the use of words like “barrel,” “ broom,” “ umbrella,” ‘‘ pounded” ; not only placed at the points of stress but repeated. “ Barrel” occurs three times, but not too obviously, so that the effect is the greater. In his Santa Fé Trail he pits the ugly clacking noise of the motor-car horns and the rattle and roar of the adjacent railroad against the sentimental singing of a small bird, the Rachel Jane—a poem well worth looking out. He has discovered, as Miss Sitwell also has, that whenever a nasty, flat, bad, aggravating noise is wanted, a succession of short a’s do the trick as featly as any other combination of sounds.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_104_0	The deliberate hissing noise of restlessness which Moses made will have been noticed in the quotation from Rosenberg : his
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_105_0	“. . . restless so restless Behind white mists invisibly My thoughts stood like a mountain.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_106_0	And after all this, one may with profit turn up Tennyson’s song from The Princess, where classical texture is tuned up to the point of sharpness:
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_107_0	“The splendour falls on castle walls And snowy summits old in story : The long light shakes across the lakes, And the wild cataract leaps in glory,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_108_0	and to the quietness of
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_109_0	“Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more, For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not here.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_110_0	Messrs Eliot, Sacheverell Sitwell, Rickword, among other poets of the Left, know these passages well, perhaps too well, and frequently use traditional texture as well as metre, rhyme, and diction for satiric ends, or as a heightening of contrast for their more revolutionary pieces; or perhaps they have moments when revolution palls. They are the déclassé aristocrats of poetry who cannot quite forget the social position that 1s theirs by right however violently they have quarrelled with society. (Tolstoi according to Maxim Gorki was of that type.) They wear peasant’s blouses and corduroy trousers on occasion, and even rags, but never part with their signet rings of scholarship and erudition. Others whose malcontentment with tradition is not too strong will actually throw off a poem like Mr Aldous Huxley’s ‘Leda ”—long, rhymed couplets, admirably classical in execution though erotic in tone—and enclose it spitefully in a volume of witty and pathological verse on the subject of guts, adolescence, or putridity.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_111_0	RHYME
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_112_0	Tue use of rhyme is a vexed question among Conservatives. Milton, Spenser, or Campion, who all as a matter of fact used rhyme, agreed to condemn it as a barbarity. And there are those who still agree ; there is no rhyming in the Latin and Greek classics, which ends the argument so far as the Die-hards are concerned. But on the whole rhyme has it.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_113_0	The Liberals not only approve of rhyme whole-heartedly but they feel undressed without it, not being allowed to wear the heavy ornaments of heroic diction. On the Left, rhyme is again a vexed question. Some abandon it altogether for exactly the opposite reasons for which the Diehards abandon it, that it is too civilised ; as Mr Flint writes in the essay from which I have already quoted: “ Rhyme is a silly ornament, a nuisance to the ear of a reader educated to appreciate the essential qualities of poetry.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_114_0	Others use rhyme doubtfully and are pleased with assonances and near-rhymes of various sorts. ‘This is from Wilfred Owen’s Strange Meetings :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_115_0	“‘ It seemed that out of the battle I escaped Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped Through granites which Titanic wars had groined, Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned, Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred. Then, as I probed them, one sprang up and stared With piteous recognition in fixed eyes.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_116_0	The heavy, fateful, nightmareish atmosphere of a Hindenburg tunnel is suggested by the texture “ down some profound dull tunnel,” and by the fact that the consonants of the assonances do not vary: “ escaped,” “scooped,” “ groined,” “ groaned,” “ bestirred,” “stared.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_117_0	Some, among whom Mr Sacheverell Sitwell, rhyme a stressed syllable with an unstressed, which gives a feeling of uncertainty, incompleteness, waiting, where this is required. The general view of rhyme among Conservatives who allow it, and among Liberals, is that rhyme must on No account appear to control the sense. It must come as unexpectedly and yet as inevitably as presents at Christmas. To write rhyme correctly one must give that general sense of free-will within predestination which is a comfort to many. And the chimes must answer each other harmoniously whatever the subject treated. Now writers like Miss Sitwell, who reject the orthodox opinions of philosophers and religious writers, express their dissatisfaction with all the means at their disposal in metre, texture, diction, and as for thyme, not only employ false rhymes, French thymes, Cockney rhymes, assonances, stressed with unstressed, and similar violences, but let the rhymes seem to guide the sense, thus definitely challenging the ethical system with which the orderly use of rhyme is associated; putting forward a view of life as being wedded in error and ugliness, and ruled by caprice. As a matter of fact Miss Sitwell seldom comes out with as direct an arraignment of the philosophical and ethical structure as I have credited her with, but it is implied in all her work. She will even quite sincerely avow herself a traditionalist, but that is no more than bearing lightly home the handle of the family pitcher after it has gone to the
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_117_1	well once too often.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_118_0	From Miss Sitwell’s “ Facade” :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_119_0	“The wind’s bastinado Whipt on the calico Skin of the Macaroon And the black Picaroon Beneath the galloon Of the midnight sky. Came the great soldan In his sedan, Floating his fan— Saw what the sly Shadow’s cocoon In the barrocoon Held. Out they fly. ‘ This melon, Sir Mammon, Comes out of Babylon ; Buy for a patacoon, Sir, you must buy.’ ”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_120_0	There has been in the past a good deal of “ bad rhyming” in uneducated quarters; nursery rhymes, country ballads, public-house ditties, merely denote an unfastidious ear ; but I must mention in passing a poem “Old Eliza,” by Mr Claude Abbott, a clever but not always effective Liberal. In order to suggest this rurality he deliberately rhymes “ candlestick ”’ with “ lit,” avoiding the natural rhyme “ wick,” and repeats the same performance lower down to show that it is intentional. Politically this would be called “ playing down to the working classes,” and the technical dexterity of Mr Abbott’s other pieces does not make the appeal convincing. Mr Masefield, who has now become a chief prop of Liberalism, similarly rhymes in his long narrative poem, Right Royal, a grey “ bowler” with a coloured boxer from “ Hispaniola,” wishing in the passage to suggest 4 crowd in holiday mood. And he knows enough of crowds to be able to bring the rhyme off, if he could keep the whole poem dressed up in the same style. But too poetical things happen: one of the jockeys has come to grief and calls out to the hero as he thuds by that he has a chance of catching up the rest of the field.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_121_0	“They flowed like the Severn, they’ll ebb like the tide.” 36
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_122_0	This is what Conservative journals mean when they complain of Liberal “wobbling,” it comes from an impossible, if courageous, attempt to please both flank parties. The poetical passage, which embodies a discreet reference to Sir Walter Scott, will not flatter the Conservative into admitting “ bowler-Hispaniola” as a new locus classicus. Or not until Mr Masefield dies (may the day be far away) and is duly buried in the Poet’s Corner.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_123_0	I can suggest an explanation why the Conservatives and steadier Liberals should lay so much stress on the necessity of the consonants being identical in all rhyming syllables, even when, as in “dawn” and “morn,” “ bowler” and “ Hispaniola,” only Celts and other provincials distinguish the a from the er. For, in spite of the pretence of the perfect rhyme, there is a great deal of approved evasion where the rhyming vowel is concerned: thus “ have” and “grave,” “earth” and “ hearth,” “together”? and “wither,” have been approved by four centuries of usage, licensed under the heading of near-rhyme, sightrhyme, and so on. But it is, I think, only the passage of time that has changed most of these rhymes from original complete harmony ; while the pronunciation of one or both has changed, the convenience of the rhyme has been jealously guarded. Then on the analogy of such genuine survivals other near-rhymes have been approved. But the consonants do not change as easily as vowels, and that is why they are kept strictly matched.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_124_0	STRUCTURE
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_125_0	There is not opportunity here for expanding this subject as it deserves. The actual structure of Conservative poetry is at first sight too familiar for discussion, but without detailed historical interpretation, as anomalous and strange as the British Constitution itself. Recently, I had the task of reviewing the collected poems of Herbert Trench, a poet of the Right Wing, and, though an Irishman, well anglicised by Oxford, so that he had turned his back on the mystery-mongering of the Yeats-ae-Colum group. I found it very dificult to review him, not only because of his recent death, and many friends, and a considerable reputation which I do not want to smirch, and could not if I would, but because also, according to his editor Mr Harold Williams, Trench was an avowed traditionalist in his judgment of human and artistic values, and imbued with the pure classical spirit. I read his “ Deirdre Wedded ” (written before Mr Yeats’ “ Deirdre”), his “ Apollo and the Seaman,” his “ Battle of the Marne,” with respect for their craftsmanship, solidity, and golden phrasing, so I thought “ Here is, in the traditional sense, a true poet, and yet neither I nor my friends who sit facing Mr Trenc across the gangway will find anything much in him to enjoy. Many people seem to think. . . . Many people seem to think”... And then the rest of the rhyme came into my head, grotesque, ungrammatical, vivid, the antithesis , grotesque, ungrammatical, vivid, the
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_125_1	antithesis of everything that Trench could ever have written:
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_126_0	“ Many people seem to think Plaster of Paris good to drink. Though conducive unto quiet I prefer another diet.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_127_0	And I recalled also the queer interpretative illustrations done on rough bamboo paper by the author, Gelett Burgess, for the Lark: a group of earnest-looking Boston intellectuals of the 1890's, drinking the vile stuff out of mugs and stiffening into the well-known poses of Discobolus, Dying Gaul, and the rest. And then I realised, what I had never seen before, that Burgess, a romantic Radical, was satirising the contemporary Right Wing and their theory of Art and Poetry.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_128_0	For the Right Wing thinks of poetry as an easily prepared substance, a well-dehydrated gypsum, for instance, which can be stored in a cool place until required, and then moistened with any emotional or intellectual liquid and poured into prepared moulds. These moulds the poet may make himself, provided he observes certain measurements and does not decorate them too fantastically. But he must not let them crack when he pours the stuff in rather hot.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_129_0	Burgess has carried the metaphor to romantic excess by showing the poets in a rigor artis after using their own bodies as classical moulds: which is the sure result of habitually taking plaster of Paris. Now, Trench drank the very best plaster, compounded by himself according to his own recipe; he chose his moulds carefully ; he saw that they fitted close, and smoothed off the slight ridges afterwards. But, as I say, the revolutionaries will be unlikely to respect this craftsmanship: they will find any deep draught of his work conducive unto quiet, they will prefer another diet.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_130_0	The question of structure really concerns the legitimate relations of ideas within a poem. Tradition enjoins that certain relations of ideas are more worthy than others, because reason must rule both in religion, civics, and poetics. The word “ God,” for instance, is at the summit of the whole pyramid of ideas, because God is Universal Mind, and Mind is (unfortunately, I think) identified with Reason. ‘The word “ God ” should decently be associated with Omnipotence, Prayer, Mercy, and so on: not blasphemously with trifles like ‘‘ bootlace,” or “ timetable.’ And though (as Samuel Butler once noted in a letter to Miss Savage) to a lexicographer “ God” may merely be the word that comes next after “ go-cart,” there is no merit in this accidental association: it must not become permanent, that is “ go-carts ” must not claim a lien on the Divine principle which would be denied to other wheeled vehicles less fortunately initialed. Similarly, just because “ wisteria” rhymes with “ hysteria” there is no cogent reason for continually mating these two ideas as Miss Sitwell does. ‘‘ Wisteria ” should mate (if sadeed the flower has been listed in the register) with “ clematis,” “ porch,” “ home-thoughts from abroad.” Again, the fact that a poet owns or is owned by a dog called Wolf, is no excuse for distorting, in poetry, the generally accepted Wolf-idea of fierceness and rapacity into one of faithfulness and good-humour. I remember once seeing a list of
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_130_1	appropriate adjectives for poetic nouns in a gradus bound up at the end of a late-seventeenth-century miscellany. ‘“ Zephyr,” for instance, was cool, cooling, amorous, curious, balmy, and so on. “ Bread ” was wholesome, wheaten, oaten, crisp, homely, tasty, and so on. If “Wolf” was there he was, without doubt, greedy, gluttonous, savage, coward, with privy paw, ravening, and the rest. Never could he escape these attributions while the Almighty continued to reign.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_131_0	The Left Wing challenges all these inhibitive rules, denying the whole philosophical and ethical and aesthetic structure on which they rest—‘ zephyr” in the Sitwell world, for instance, is liable to become “ bird-soft,” “wooden,” : creaking,” “with satyr-hooves,” “ owl-dark,” “scorching, oranything else, The free-associative method is held to be as reputable as the method of relating ideas, according to certain reasonable encyclopedic categories bound by a common quality, according to the logic of cause and effect, or according to spatio-temporal sequence. The Left Wing will expect a poem to have any growth it pleases, provided that it is organic growth. It may be upwards like a tree, or sideways like mildew, or intricately every-which-way like a cancer. It need not be bound by any preconception of how it will eventually turn out: its metre may change, its diction, purpose, characters, setting. Caprice may rule it, as they claim it also rules life; the extremists say always, the moderates say as often as not. To deny the place of caprice in poetry is deliberately to deny one’s daily experience. The incidents of any theme may be bound by the most profound or the most trifling associations, and if poetry is to interpret life, the most fantastically hinged events must appear in it ; and yet, as happens in daily life, after the moment of caprice is over, a poem written by the freest of free association methods finds that it has a structure of sorts, one broader and more
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_131_1	intense than was consciously formulated before or during composition.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_132_0	And as for the hysteria-wisteria connection, the Left will point out that the Conservative claim is no more consistent than the survival of Eton, or the Poor Laws, or Court-dress, or the House of Lords in a self-styled democracy. The traditional use of rhyme encourages such permanent partnerships as “cup” with “ drink it up,” “world? with ‘ flags furled,” “ earth ” with ‘ birth ” and “ dearth,” “ mouth ” with “ drouth ” and “ south,” “self? with an archaistic use of “elf,” and ‘ God” (not with “ go-cart ”) but with “ rod,” which is inclined to limit the attributes of God to empire and vengeance. The use of certain fixed metrical poems will similarly limit the possible relations of words, and debar others like the adverb “ necessarily,” which ends in four successive short syllables, from ever showing its head.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_133_0	Not much need be written about the structure of Liberal poetry: not much of it is written beyond lyric length. It will be found well-catenated but not on the rigid classical plan, having more in common with the modern short story or descriptive essay. Couplets or longish stanzas will be used, or blank verse. Occasionally it takes the form of poetic-drama most suitable for the repertory theatre but for its disability of being written in verse. Lyric sequences on an amorous or contemplative theme are also favoured.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_134_0	But let us discuss in greater detail the more surprising structure of Left Wing verse. Mr Eliot’s The Waste Land is a useful poem to examine, as it won the prize offered by the Dzal for the best modern imaginative work of its year. It is a structure that has gradually developed for the reader, as it seems to have gradually developed for the poet over a period of months and even years. The relations between the parts that now appear seem to have been unsuspected by him until the poem was nearly complete; and he seems to have discovered them, and tightened them up afterwards in his revision. Some of the intertwined threads on which the sequence of variously metred and dictioned and ornamented pieces are strung are: a semi-mystic ethnological theory of the “Holy Grail,” which the poet met in a book by Miss Jessie Weston; a clairvoyante’s prognostication from a Tarot pack of cards; the wish for death that follows the output of too much emotional or prophetic fire, as the Cumzan Sibyl felt it; the seer Teiresias’ double-sexed view of human relations as described in Ovid; the disciples of Christ journeying to Emmaus; Buddha’s fire-sermon. It would be wrong to deny that these themes can and do fuse into a strongly cohesive individuality, glazed and incrusted with all manner of random images from life and literature ; but impossible, I think, to find in it a structure of any purposed or educational kind. It is work
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_134_1	admirably descriptive of a glorious and complete intellectual tangle, a maze thick with cul-de-sacs, the chief of which are dissatisfaction both with Bostonianism or Oxonianism, and with the crudeness of the Philistinism which denies Boston and Oxford; conflict between theoretical hedonism and disgust of hedonism in practice ; conflict between a desire for religious mysticism and the sophistication which prevents him from abandoning himself to it. In the passage I quoted about the poet fishing in the dull canal behind the gas-house, we saw clearly the materialistic present and the idealistic past at their assaults and counter-assaults. The passage contains allusions to Marvell’s “ Coy Mistress,” to Shakespeare’s Tempest, to Verlaine’s Parsifal, and
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_135_0	“ The sound of horns and motors which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs Porter in the spring”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_136_0	is a violent parody of Day’s Parlement of Bees:
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_137_0	“ When of the sudden, listening, you shall hear A noise of horns and hunting which shall bring Acteon to Diana in the spring Where all shall see her naked skin.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_138_0	In an elaborate set of notes Mr Eliot gives us these and similar references to the literary sources of the poem, but I have no doubt that there are a great many intererelations in the piece which Mr Eliot himself has not noticed.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_139_0	The structure of The Waste Land is, in a sense, a negative structure. If a large family, kept together unwillingly in the same house by economic and social reasons, but not by any ties of true affection, could be caught at a moment of disintegration — not necessarily all in the same room together, nor even particularly conscious of each other’s activities—all making claims and each refusing to meet the other’s claims, then the intricate disharmonies of that house, the subtle cross-references of conflict, would give it an individuality as strong as that of a house where everyone was positively at peace.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_140_0	Mr Edgar Lee Master’s Spoon River Anthology has a more parochial style but a similarly negative structure. It is a series of free-verse epitaphs on the dwellers by the banks of an American river — a few pure-minded, suffering characters, but mostly cruel, hypocritical, debauched, gloating, and all at odds with each other.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_141_0	Miss Edith Sitwell’s Sleeping Beauty is in structure a succession of fantastic poetic reveries seen in a conventional mirror. She reminds me of that famous Alice who won immortality by getting tight inside a Victorian mirror and found, beyond the conventional view of drawing-room and passage, all sorts of new, strange things happening ; and she is further commendably aware that, though this fantastic view of the drawing-room has not contrariwised or no-howed the accustomed one, LookingGlass-Land is more than “only a dream,” it is another aspect of truth. What could be more conventional than the “ Sleeping Beauty ” story? But read Miss Sitwell’s version. ‘Then, if you peevishly complain: ‘ But what about Prince Charming? She has cut the story off short,” don’t forget that our familiar version is only a small part of Perrault’s original horrible tale, in which, instead of “happily ever after,” we wade in murders and obscenities, and in the end find the Sleeping Beauty cut up and dressed for a cannibalistic feast, but, we are cynically informed, her hundred-year sleep had made her mighty tough eating. Wisely, then, Miss Sitwell leaves her heroine still slumbering in the forest, and—
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_142_0	“ 'Oh far best,’ the gardener said, ‘ Like fruits to lie in your kind bed, To sleep as snug as in the grave In your kind bed and shun the wave, Nor ever sigh for a strange land And songs no heart can understand.’ ”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_143_0	The Sleeping Beauty has the inconsequent but powerful movement of a dream, and is strewn with memorable images. ‘Tradition appears as a Dowager-Queen whose two interests in life are Latin missals and a parrot :
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_144_0	“ Long ago Dead, but none dared tell her so. And therefore the bird was stuffed and restored To lifeless immortality ; bored It seemed, but yet it remained her own.”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_145_0	And we are introduced to
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_146_0	“ Country gentlemen, so countrified That in their rustic grace they try to hide Their fingers sprouting into leaves,”
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_147_0	and to Laidronette, most wicked of Society hostesses in Fairyland, as she unwigs herself for the night, disclosing “that roc’s egg, her head,” to her delighted attendant apes. (I met Laidronette once myself riding in her sedan chair, and believe this account absolutely.)
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_148_0	As fantastic and yet more consequent is Mr Sacheverell Sitwell’s Parade Virtues for a Dying Gladiator, written in a sort of remote blank verse. The scene is in a Callotesque arena. A grotesque philosopher appears, raises an ambitious, cloud-piercing structure of planks and scaffolding. As he makes his bow the whole fabric crashes and he falls. He spits blood and words. This stream from his mouth changes, dream-like, into a sea covering the arena. Ships appear and fight. A second philosopher arrives and gets torn in pieces between two grappling ships. A third philosopher makes a short protest through a horn against conventional religion and takes poison and dies. A fourth, on stilts, tries to stuff the dead bodies of his predecessors into a sack after spearing them with a a trident, but their weight breaks his stilts and he falls into the sea, where, using one stilt as a crutch, he makes a dying speech, preaching a new morality of ambition. A fall of stage snow interrupts him, for the next scene is to be a fight on sledges. He rolls snowballs and pelts the audience with them. He intends to make them weep and sneeze and so be distracted from watching his successors. I will not here attempt any detailed psychological or metaphysical interpretation: I only wish to call attention to the structure, and to the fact that a dream, however fantastic and metamorphic, can have a positive no less than a negative sense. Parade Virtues is making
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_148_1	a definite criticism of history and giving a treatise on individualism which, though anti-social and, therefore, unclassical, is, at any rate, not self-contradictory in statement.
1-8-techniques-contemporary-poetry	doc_10_149_0	The predominance of this fantastic dream structure in Left-Wing poetry I read as a challenge to the disrespectful attitude which the practical man has towards dreams, nightmares, and fantasies. It is true that classical tradition admits certain formal and educative dreams in : poetry ; indeed the medieval May-day dream is a very cz qi nuisance for its frequency ; but these admitted dreams are not really dreams at all, being purged of all their illogical and anti-social structure and elements. And while the dream is always clearly distinguished from practical life in classical poetry, “I fell asleep and then I awoke and found it was all a dream,” the Left Wing mixes up the practical life confusedly with the dream. The Right Wing regards this as madness, for the definition of insanity is that the insane does not distinguish dreaming from waking. But the Left Wing does not value the practical life more than the dream, and often a good deal less. The political analogy here is easy and important.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_0_0	COMPOSITION AS EXPLANATION
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_1_0	THERE is singularly nothing that makes a difference a difference in beginning and in the middle and in ending except that each generation has something different at which they are all looking. By this I mean so simply that anybody knows it that composition is the difference which makes each and all of them then different from other generations and this is what makes everything different otherwise they are all alike and everybody knows it because everybody says it.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_2_0	It is very likely that nearly every one has been very nearly certain that something that is interesting is interesting them. Can they and do they. It is very interesting that nothing inside in them, that is when you consider the very long history of how every one ever acted or has felt, it is very interesting that nothing inside in them in all of them makes it connectedly different. By this I mean this. The only thing that is different from one time to another is what is seen and what is seen depends upon how everybody is doing everything. This makes the thing we are looking at very different and this makes what those who describe it make of it, it makes a composition, it confuses, it shows, it is, it looks, it likes it as it is, and this makes what is seen as it is seen. Nothing changes from generation to generation except the thing seen and that makes a composition. Lord Grey remarked that when the generals before the war talked about the war they talked about it as a nineteenth century wat although to be fought with twentieth century weapons. ‘That is because war is a thing that decides how it is to be when it is to be done. It is prepared and to that degree it is like all academies it is not a thing made by being made it isathing prepared. Writing and painting and all that, is like that, for
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_2_1	those who occupy themselves with it and don’t make it as it is made. Now the few who make it as it is made, and it is to be remarked that the most decided of them usually are prepared just as the world around them is preparing, do it in this way and so I if you do not mind I will tell you how it happens. Naturally one does not know how it happened until it is well over beginning happening.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_3_0	To come back to the part that the only thing that is different is what is seen when it seems to be being seen, in other words, composition and timesense.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_4_0	No one is ahead of his time, it is only that the particular variety of creating his time is the one that his contemporaries who also are creating their own time refuse to accept. And they refuse to accept it for a very simple reason and that is that they do not have to accept it for any reason. They themselves that is everybody in their entering the modern composition and they do enter it, if they do not enter it they are not so to speak in it they are out of it and so they do enter it; but in as you may say the non-competitive efforts where if you are not in it nothing is lost except nothing at all except what is not had, there are naturally all the refusals, and the things refused are only important if unexpectedly somebody happens to need them. In the case of the arts it is very definite. Those who are creating the modern composition authentically are naturally only of importance when they are dead because by that time the modern composition having become past is classified and the description of it is classical. That is the reason why the creator of the new composition in the arts is an outlaw until he is a classic, there is hardly a moment in between and it is really too bad very much too bad naturally for the creator but also very much too bad for the enjoyer, they all really would
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_4_1	enjoy the created so much better just after it has been made than when it is already a classic, but it is perfectly simple that there is no reason why the contemporaries should see, because it would not make any difference as they lead their lives in the new composition anyway, and as every one is naturally indolent why naturally they don’t see. For this reason as in quoting Lord Grey it is quite certain that nations not actively threatened are at least several generations behind themselves militarily so aesthetically they are more than several generations behind themselves and it is very much too bad, it is so very much more exciting and satisfactory for everybody if one can have contemporaries, if all one’s contemporaries could be one’s contemporaries.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_5_0	There is almost not an interval.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_6_0	For a very long time everybody refuses and then almost without a pause almost everybody accepts. In the history of the refused in the arts and literature the rapidity of the change is always startling. Now the only difficulty with the volte-face concerning the arts is this. When the acceptance comes, by that acceptance the thing created becomes a classic. It is a natural phenomena a rather extraordinary natural phenomena that a thing accepted becomes a classic. And what is the characteristic quality of a classic. The characteristic quality of a classic is that it is beautiful. Now of course it is perfectly true that a more or less first rate work of art is beautiful but the trouble is that when that first rate work of art becomes a classic because it is accepted the only thing that is important from then on to the majority of the acceptors the enormous majority, the most intelligent majority of the acceptors is that it is so wonderfully beautiful. Of course it is wonderfully beautiful, only when it is still a thing irritating annoying stimulating then all quality of beauty is denied to it.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_7_0	Of course it is beautiful but first all beauty in it is denied and then all the beauty of it is accepted. If every one were not so indolent they would realise that beauty is beauty even when it is irritating and stimulating not only when it is accepted and classic. Of course it is extremely difficult nothing more so than to remember back to its not being beautiful once it has become beautiful. ‘This makes it so much more difficult to realise its beauty when the work is being refused and prevents every one from realising that they were convinced that beauty was denied, once the work is accepted. Automatically with the acceptance of the time-sense comes the recognition of the beauty and once the beauty is accepted the beauty never fails any one.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_8_0	Beginning again and again is a natural thing even when there is a series.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_9_0	Beginning again and again and again explaining composition and time is a natural thing.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_10_0	It is understood by this time that everything is the same except composition and time, composition and the time of the composition and the time in the composition.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_11_0	Everything is the same except composition and as the composition is different and always going to be different everything is not the same. Everything is not the same as the time when of the composition and the time in the composition is different. The composition is different, that is certain.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_12_0	The composition is the thing seen by every one living in the living they are doing, they are the composing of the composition that at the time they are living is the composition of the time in which they are living. It is that that makes living a thing they are doing. Nothing else is different, of that almost any one can be certain. The time when and the time of and the time in that composition is the natural phenomena of that composition and of that perhaps every one can be certain.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_13_0	No one thinks these things when they are making when they are creating what is the composition, naturally no one thinks, that is no one formulates until what is to be formulated has been made.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_14_0	Composition is not there, it is going to be there and we are here. This is some time ago for us naturally.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_15_0	The only thing that is different from one time to another is what is seen and what is seen depends upon how everybody is doing everything. This makes the thing we are looking at very different and this makes what those who describe it make of it, it makes a composition, it confuses, it shows, it is, it looks, it likes it as it is, and this makes what is seen as it is seen. Nothing changes from generation to generation except the thing seen and that makes a composition.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_16_0	Now the few who make writing as it is made and it is to be remarked that the most decided of them are those that are prepared by preparing, are prepared just as the world around them is prepared and is preparing to do it in this way and so if you do not mind I will again tell you how it happens. Naturally one does not know how it happened until it is well over beginning happening.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_17_0	Each period of living differs from any other period of living not in the way life is but in the way life is conducted and that authentically speaking is composition. After life has been conducted in a certain way everybody knows it but nobody knows it, little by little, nobody knows it as long as nobody knows it. Any one creating the composition in the arts does not know it either, they are conducting life and that makes their composition what it is, it makes their work compose as it does.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_18_0	Their influence and their influences are the same as that of all of their contemporaries only it must always be remembered that the analogy is not obvious until as I say the composition of a time has become so pronounced that it is past and the artistic composition of it is a classic.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_19_0	And now to begin as if to begin. Composition is not there, it is going to be there and we are here. This is some time ago for us naturally. There is something to be added afterwards.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_20_0	Just how much my work is known to you I do not know. I feel that perhaps it would be just as well to tell the whole of it.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_21_0	In beginning writing I wrote a book called Three Lives this was written in 1905. I wrote a negro story called Melanctha. In that there was a constant recurring and beginning there was a marked direction in the direction of being in the present although naturally I had been accustomed to past present and future, and why, because the composition forming around me was a prolonged present. A composition of a prolonged present is a natural composition in the world as it has been these thirty years it was more and more a prolonged present. I created then a prolonged present naturally I knew nothing of a continuous present but it came naturally to me to make one, it was simple it was clear to me and nobody knew why it was done like that, I did not myself although naturally to me it was natural.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_22_0	After that I did a book called The Making of Americans it is a long book about a thousand pages.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_23_0	Here again it was all so natural to me and more and more complicatedly a continuous present. A continuous present is a continuous present. I made almost a thousand pages of a continuous present.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_24_0	Continuous present is one thing and beginning again and again is another thing. These are both things. And then there is using everything.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_25_0	This brings us again to composition this the using everything. The using everything brings us to composition and to this composition. A continuous present and using everything and beginning again. In these two books there was elaboration of the complexities of using everything and of a continuous present and of beginning again and again and again.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_26_0	In the first book there was a groping for a continuous present and for using everything by beginning again and again.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_27_0	There was a groping for using everything and there was a groping for a continuous present and there was an inevitable beginning of beginning again and again and again.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_28_0	Having naturally done this I naturally was a little troubled with it when I read it. I became then like the others who read it. One does, you know, excepting that when I reread it myself I lost myself in it again. Then I said to myself this time it will be different and I began. I did not begin again I just began.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_29_0	In this beginning naturally since I at once went on and on very soon there were pages and pages and pages more and more elaborated creating a more and more continuous present including more and more using of everything and continuing more and more beginning and beginning and beginning.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_30_0	I went on and on to a thousand pages of it.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_31_0	In the meantime to naturally begin I commenced making portraits of anybody and anything. In making these portraits I naturally made a continuous present an including everything and a beginning again and again within a very small thing. That started me into composing anything into one thing. So then naturally it was natural that one thing an enormously long thing was not everything an enormously short thing was also not everything nor was it all of it a continuous present thing nor was it always and always beginning again. Naturally I would then begin again. I would begin again I would naturally begin. I did naturally begin. This brings me to a great deal that has been begun.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_32_0	And after that what changes what changes after that, after that what changes and what changes after that and after that and what changes and after that and what changes after that.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_33_0	The problem from this time on became more definite.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_34_0	It was all so nearly alike it must be different and it is different, it is natural that if everything is used and there is a continuous present and a beginning again and again if it is all so alike it must be simply different and everything simply different was the natural way of creating it then.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_35_0	In this natural way of creating it then that it was simply different everything being alike it was simply different, this kept on leading one to lists. Lists naturally for a while and by lists I mean a series. More and more in going back over what was done at this time I find that I naturally kept simply different as an intention. Whether there was or whether there was not a continuous present did not then any longer trouble me there was or there was, and using everything no longer troubled me if everything is alike using everything could no longer trouble me and beginning again and again could no longer trouble me because if lists were inevitable if series were inevitable and the whole of it was inevitable beginning again and again could not trouble me so then with nothing to trouble me I very completely began naturally since everything is alike making it as simply different naturally as simply different as possible. I began doing natural phenomena what I call natural phenomena and natural phenomena naturally everything being alike natural phenomena are making things be naturally simply different. This found its culmination later, in the beginning it began in a center confused with lists with series with geography with returning portraits and with particularly often four and three and often with five and four. It is easy to see that in the beginning such a conception as everything being naturally different would be very inarticulate and very
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_35_1	slowly it began to emerge and take the form of anything, and then naturally if anything that is simply different is simply different what follows will follow. 22
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_36_0	So far then the progress of my conceptions was the natural progress entirely in accordance with my epoch as I am sure is to be quite easily realised if you think over the scene that was before us all from year to year.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_37_0	As I said in the beginning, there is the long history of how every one ever acted or has felt and that nothing inside in them in all of them makes it connectedly different. By this I mean all this.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_38_0	The only thing that is different from one time to another is what is seen and what is seen depends upon how everybody is doing everything.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_39_0	It is understood by this time that everything is the same except composition and time, composition and the time of the composition and the time in the composition.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_40_0	Everything is the same except composition and as the composition is different and always going to be different
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_41_0	everything is not the same. So then I as a contemporary creating the’ composition in the beginning was groping toward a continuous present, a using everything a beginning again and again and then everything being alike then everything very simply everything was naturally simply different and so I as a contemporary was creating everything being alike was creating everything naturally being naturally simply different, everything being alike. This then was the period that brings me to the period of the beginning of 1914. Everything being alike everything naturally would be simply different and war came and everything being alike and everything being simply different brings everything being simply different brings it to romanticism,
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_42_0	Romanticism is then when everything being alike everything is naturally simply different, and romanticism.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_43_0	Then for four years this was more and more different even though this was, was everything alike. Everything alike naturally everything was simply different and this is and was romanticism and this is and was war. Everything being alike everything naturally everything is different simply different naturally simply different.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_44_0	And so there was the natural phenomena that was war, which had been, before war came, several generations behind the contemporary composition, because it became war and so completely needed to be contemporary became completely contemporary and so created the completed recognition of the contemporary composition. Every one but one may say every one became consciously became aware of the existence of the authenticity of the modern composition. This then the contemporary recognition, because of the academic thing known as war having been forced to become contemporary made every one not only contemporary in act not only contemporary in thought but contemporary in self-consciousness made every one contemporary with the modern composition. And so the art creation of the contemporary composition which would have been outlawed normally outlawed several generations more behind even than war, war having been brought so to speak up to date art so to speak was allowed not completely to be up to date, but nearly up to date, in other words we who created the expression of the modern composition were to be recognised before we were dead some of us even quite a long time before we were dead. And so war may be said to have advanced a general recognition of the expression of the contemporary composition by almost thirty years.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_45_0	And now after that there is no more of that in other words there is peace and something comes then and it follows coming then.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_46_0	And so now one finds oneself interesting oneself in an equilibration, that of course means words as well as things and distribution as well as between themselves between the words and themselves and the things and themselves, a distribution as distribution. This makes what follows what follows and now there is every reason why there should be an arrangement made. Distribution is interesting and equilibration is interesting when a continuous present and a beginning again and again and using everything and everything alike and everything naturally simply different has been done.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_47_0	After all this, there is that, there has been that that there is a composition and that nothing changes except composition the composition and the time of and the time in the composition.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_48_0	The time of the composition is a natural thing and the time in the composition is a natural thing it is a natural thing and it is a contemporary thing.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_49_0	The time of the composition is the time of the composition. It has been at times a present thing it has been at times a past thing it has been at times a future thing it has been at times an endeavour at parts or all of these things. In my beginning it was a continuous present a beginning again and again and again and again, it was a series it was a list it was a similarity and everything different it was a distribution and an equilibration. That is all of the time some of the time of the composition.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_50_0	Now there is still something else the time-sense in the composition. This is what is always a fear a doubt and a judgement and a conviction, The quality in the creation of expression the quality in a composition that makes it go dead just after it has been made is very troublesome.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_51_0	The time in the composition is a thing that is very troublesome. If the time in the composition is very troublesome it is because there must even if there is no time at all in the composition there must be time in the composition which is in its quality of distribution and equilibration. In the beginning there was the time in the composition that naturally was in the composition but time in the composition comes now and this is what is now troubling every one the time in the composition is now a part of distribution and equilibration. In the beginning there was confusion there was a continuous present and later there was romanticism which was not a confusion but an extrication and now there is either succeeding or failing there must be distribution and equilibration there must be time that is distributed and equilibrated. This is the thing that is at present the most troubling and if there is the time that is at present the most troublesome the time-sense that is at present the most troubling is the thing that makes the present the most troubling. There is at present there is distribution, by this I mean expression and time, and in this way at present composition is time that is the reason that at present the time-sense is troubling that is the reason why at present the time-sense in the composition is the composition that is making what there is in composition.
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_52_0	And afterwards. Now that is all.

We find them and they find them and water finds them and they grow best where we meant to suggest. We suggested that we would go there again. A woman leaning forward. She was necessarily taken to be no taller. A girl. If she may say what she will say she will say that there were a quantity of voices and they were white and then darker. A woman with two bundles. If she did it to be useful if she did not even attract the same throne. What did I say. Did royalists say that they did not have this to say to-day. Standing. Measure an alarm by refusing to alarm them and they this not as a disaster but as a pretension. Do you pretend to be unfavourable to their thought. Eighth. If you hold heavily heavily instead. Instead of in there. Did you not intend to show this to them. Saint. A Saint. Saint and very well I thank you. Two in bed. Two in bed. Yes two in bed. They had eaten.

Do not acknowledge to me that seven are said that a Saint and seven that it is said that a saint in seven that there is said to be a saint in seven. Now as to illuminations. They are going to illuminate and every one is to put into their windows their most beautiful object and every one will say and the streets will be crowded every one will say look at it. They do say look at it. To look at it. They will look at it. They will say look at it. If it should rain they will all be there. If it should be windy they will all be there. Who will be there. They will all be there. Names of streets named after the saint. Names of places named after the saint. Names of saints named after the saint. Names of sevens named after the saint. The saints in sevens. Noon-light for Roman arches. He left fairly early. Let them make this seen. Louise giggled. Michael was not angry nor was he stuttering nor was he able to silence them. He was angry he was stuttering and he was able to answer them. They were nervous. Josephine was able to be stouter. Amelia was really not repaid. And the taller younger and
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_75_2	weaker older and straighter one said come to eat again. Michael was not able to come angrily to them. He angrily muttered for them. Louise was separated to Heloise and not by us. So then you see saints for them. Louise. Heloise. Amelia. Josephine. Seven, a saint in seven and in this way it was not Paul. Paul was deprived of nothing. Saint in seven a saint in seven. Who. A saint in seven. Owls and bees. If you please. Paul makes honey and orange trees. Michael makes coal and celery. Louise makes rugs and reasonably long. Heloise makes the sea and she settles well away from it. Amelia does not necessarily please. She does not place herself near linen. Josephine measures a little toy and she may be no neater. Eleanor has been more satisfied and feeble. She does not look as able to stay nor does she seem as able to go any way. Saints in seven makes italics sombre. I make fun of him of her. I make fun of them. They make fun of them of this. They make fun of him of her. She makes fun of of them of him. He makes fun of them of her. They make fun of her. He makes fun of them. She makes fun of him. I make fun of them. We have made them march. She has made a procession. A saint in seven and there were six. A saint in seven and there were eight. A

A saint in seven. And when do they sleep again. A ring around the moon is seen to follow the moon and the moon is in the center of the ring and the ring follows the moon. Sleeping, to-day sleeping to-day is nearly a necessity and to-day coals reward the five. One two three four five. Corals reward the five. In this way they are not leaning with the intention of being a hindrance to satisfaction. A saint in seven is told of bliss, I will know why they open so. Carefully seen to be safely arranged. One two three four five six seven. A saint in seven. To begin in this way. Carefully attended carefully attended to this. If we had seen if they had seen if we had seen what was in between, they went very slowly so that we might know but to be slow and we were not slow and to show and they showed it and we did not decide because we had already come to a decision. Saints in seven are a very large number. Seven and seven is not as pretty as five and five. And five and five need not mean more. Now to remember how to mean to be gay. Gayly the boxer the boxer very gayly depresses no one. He
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_75_4	seems he does seem he dreams he does dream he seems to dream. Extra readiness to recall himself to these places. Thanks so much for startling. Do not by any means start to worship in order to be excellent. He is excellent again and again. A saint can share expenses he can share and he can be interested in their place. Their place is plentifully sprinkled as they bend forward. And no one does mean to contend any more. A saint in seven plentifully. None of it is good. It has been said that the woods are the poor man’s overcoat but we have found the mountains which are near by and not high can be an overcoat to us. Can he be an overcoat to us. A saint in seven wished to be convinced by us that the mountains near by and not high can give protection from the wind. One does not have to consider rain because it cannot rain here. A saint in seven wishes to be convinced by us that the mountains which are near by would act as a protection to those who find it cold and yet when one considers that nothing is suffering neither men women children lambs roses and broom, broom is yellow when one considers that neither broom, roses lambs men children and women none of them suffer neither here nor in the mountains near by the mountains are not high and if it were not true that every one had
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_75_5	to be sure that that they were there every one would be persuaded that they had persuaded that they had been persuaded that this was true. He told us that he knew that the name was the same. A saint in seven can declare this to be true. He comes again. Yes he comes again and what does he say he says do you know this do you refuse no more than you give. That is the way to spell it do you refuse no more than you give. He searches for more than one word. He manages to eat finally and as he does so and as he does so and as he does so he manages to cut the water in two. If water is flowing down a canal and it is understood that the canal is full if the canal has many outlets for irrigation purposes and the whole country is irrigated if even the mountains are irrigated by the canal and in this way neither oil nor seeds nor wood is needed and it is needed by them why then do the examples remain here examples of industry of cowardice of pleasure of reasonable sight seeing of objections and of lands and oceans. We do not know oceans. We do not know measures. Measure and measure and then decide that a servant beside, what is a servant beside. No one knows how easily he can authorise him to go, how easily she can authorise her to
2-1-composition-explanation	doc_11_75_6	go how easily they can authorise them to come and to go. I authorise you to come and go. I authorise you to go. I authorise you to go and come.

1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_1_0	CHAPTER I AGIN' THE GOVERNMENT
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_2_0	When I read in the papers of a convict escaping whole neighbourhood hunting him down, why do I want him to evade his hunters, and why am I sorry when he is caught? My feeling (which is also yours) is not due to any opinions I may hold on the subject of crime and punishment. Nor is it, I think, at root, a merely instinctive flash of sympathy with the underdog in an unequal struggle, though that comes nearer to the truth. I even find a feebler and more evanescent sympathy with the burglar, who, single-handed, breaks into a house for pillage. This feeling again is not due to any doubts about the sanctity of property, and it yields to the least reflection.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_3_0	Some adherents of law and order, indeed, may never have this feeling. But I have. Nor is it completely explained by the natural zest for violent risk-taking that seizes the imagination of those whose quiet life affords no outlet for such risks. This positive and active sympathy with law-breakers is natural for most red-blooded boys, though they are soon taught to repress its utterance. But for mature and sober manhood! Let us look a little closer at our burglar. If he is armed and confronted by an awakened householder, I stand for the latter. But if the police are after him, and, climbing to the roof, he makes a perilous run for liberty, my heart goes with him, whether he carries the swag with him or leaves it behind. If I sat in court next day adjudicating the case, I should doubtless have adjusted my feelings with better conformity to my regard for the interests of society. But my first feeling still deserves some consideration.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_4_0	Or take another instance. Why are the police in forceful execution of their duty unpopular with an ordinary crowd of decent working people? This sentiment may not be strong and can easily be turned by tact or courage into one of active support. But it is there, and vigorous police action, even in arrest of lawbreakers, easily arouses popular resentment, unless the sort of law-breaking itself has stirred a strong sentiment of reprobation.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_5_0	"We give approval to Law and Order, but we do not like them, or their methods, or their instruments. Take the most general test, our feeling towards Government and officialism. The natural man is ""agin'"" the Government, at any rate whenever it takes concrete shape in law and administration. And this irrespective of its quality. Nay, though bad government may arouse more impassioned resentment, "" good"" government evokes no affection. Indeed, there is a dislike of government because it is ""good."" Efficiency involves ""officiousness."" Rigorous enforcement of laws, without respect to persons or particular circumstances, is a cold-blooded justice which offends our feeling of humanity. Take India. The dislike of the British Raj is far less due to the fact that it is an expensive enforced rule of foreigners than that it is orderly, impersonal, implacable, inhuman, even incorruptible. Most Indians would probably prefer a looser, more disorderly, more despotic rule under a Rajah whose present personality and erratic conduct gave human interest to the scene. Just as it is difficult for religion to survive the loss of a presiding Deity, so political government loses hold of the heart of the people when it divorces itself from personal leadership and becomes Law and Order."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_6_0	"This is no plea for return to personal government, where sovereignty is vested in some autocracy or some decorative head. The scrutiny goes deeper. It is ""law and order"" itself that the natural man is ""up against."" He is not an anarchist. He wants some law and some order, but in moderation. Unerring law fails to recognise that to err is human. If ""order is Heaven's first law,' its second is disorder. That brings us to the root of the complaint against civilisation as it is commonly presented. The arts of civilisation, not politics alone, are engaged in bringing order, security, certainty into the lives of peoples. Standards of mass production put uniformity upon the activities of human beings in their industries, trades, professions for even the most learned professions and the finest arts come in some degree under this economy of routine production. Standards of living carry the same stamp of uniformity into ever nicer gradings of varieties. Economic progress consists in an everincreasing refinement of this producer consumer's order."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_7_0	"Kickers against this standardisation of the economic system, humanists such as Ruskin, Carpenter, Tolstoy, over-reached themselves. They failed clearly to pose the question: How much system, how much standardisation, how much ""law and order"" is it good to have ?"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_8_0	"Reflection upon modern man more and more closely packed in standard cities discloses a crop of disconcerting problems"" which represent the efforts of repressed or thwarted instincts to find expression. Men are not satisfied. There is ""unrest."" unrest."" Blind politicians and reformers seek remedies in further measures for insuring minimum standard conditions, under the mistaken notion that what discontented workers want most is security of living."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_9_0	"The real discontent goes far deeper. What the city man and woman want most is some let-up from the oppressive burden of monotony and routine in the ordinary city life, some risk, chance, and skill in the game of life. ""What nonsense,"" some will say, risks and chances everywhere abound, the physical and moral life of man is exposed to countless dangers, and as for skill, everyone has his work cut out to steer a prosperous, or safe course through life."" And it is true that the chief attraction drawing more and more of the rural population into city life has been the craving for adventure which cities seem to offer. Cities were more dangerous, men lived there shorter and more irregular lives. But that was before city life had been reduced to order and hygiene. Now ""relief"" from city order has to be sought more and more in drink, drugs, sex dissipation, gambling, and sensational amusements. And reform takes shape more and more in efforts to stop these ventilating shafts for thwarted instincts, or to regulate their operation. Has anyone thought out the human significance of a city life where every ""social problem"" has been solved, and where good order prevailed among all sorts and conditions of men? Perhaps some answer can be found by means of the facile phrase ""sublimation of the instincts"" the natural cravings for risk, adventure, and personal achievement being diverted into innocent or even virtuous channels. Possibly by moral and intellectual equivalents for war,"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_9_1	"sex, greed, and other crude egoistic impulses we could make ""our life sublime""! But are we certain that the rarified atmosphere of such sublimity would satisfy the claims of the animal within us whose instincts suffer this air-change? May it not be necessary to make a compromise on a lower level with the forces of disorder?"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_10_0	"How much wiser the Catholic Church with its allowance for revelry than the repressive regularities of Puritanism. ""It is sometimes a good thing to give oneself an airing outside the strict diocese of the conscience."" How to make proper provision for this margin of disorder in the economy of social life is of prime importance at a time when science conspires with ethics to impress the dominance of physical and moral order. The common human resentment against a prig attests the same economy of righteousness. ""A prig is someone who tries to shut up the universe in his black hole of a conscience.” 1 It is significant that these problems stand out so conspicuous in that city life which has given its title to ""civilisation."" Is it possible we may be in danger of carrying ""civility too far? That "" polis"" may bring too much polish? Art recognises the quality of ""roughness"" in design and execution. May we not be aiming at too fine a finish in the art of living?"

1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_12_0	CHAPTER II
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_13_0	THE REVOLT AGAINST REASON
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_14_0	Not in the practical fields of social and personal conduct alone does the problem of the limitations of Law and Order arise. In the world of philosophy and science, thinkers have been eagerly competing to limit the reign of reason and the competence of logic. In part, psychology has forced their hands, by laying bare the origin of reason as a tool of the animal instincts. As a river can never rise above its source, so reason, however freed from its original servitude to the senses, can never answer the final questions about the nature and purpose of the universe or of man's place in it. Hence we find thinkers so different in the texture of their thinking as Bergson and Vaihinger finding the valid answers to these ultimate questions in the realm of practical experience.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_15_0	"There is ""system"" or ""order"" in Nature as in our thinking about Nature-there is possibly a system if we could reach it, though we cannot-but there not departmental systems. Yet pride and sort of aesthetic craving incessantly impels thinkers to piece together their bits of intellectual order into a completeness and an objectivity they do not possess. This is particularly true of thinking in fields where thought is not closely addressed to what are termed hard facts, e.g. history, the mental and social sciences, philosophy."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_16_0	There is among philosophers a desperate desire to incorporate in a system of thought elements essentially recalcitrant against system. It is, I think, a last attempt to save the face of formal philosophy. For the admission, that thought and language are in origin and function incapable of doing more than confronting us with a series of irreconcilable positions, implies the renunciation of philosophy's secular boast to place a coping stone upon the edifice of human knowledge.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_17_0	"But the revolt against systems of thought goes further. The disappearance of the hard, self-sufficing specialisms of physics and chemistry, of the division between the organic and inorganic sciences, of the separation of biology from psychology, the interpenetration of the social sciences, all testify to a loosening of the entire thought process. Most of all is this seen in the disposition of the great seminal thinkers of our age to break away from formal scientific presentations in order to use artistic or loose literary devices for the communication of their thought. So humanists like Tolstoy, Shaw, and Anatole France couch their philosophy of life in dramas or in fiction sketches, while Samuel Butler and Havelock Ellis, the most stimulating general thinkers of their age in Britain, have sought even looser methods of expression. The return of the Diary is perhaps the best tribute to the success of the revolt against the arrogance and falsity of over-system. For in these records of passing thoughts and feelings we may hope to escape the temptation to fill out our fragments of personal experience into some excessive pattern of objective truth. The new humour of psychology justifies the suspicions which practical man has always entertained towards the theorist, of presenting his private fancies as systems of authoritative principles. This temptation creeps from theory into practice. A panegyrist of Mr Justice Holmes recently described him as ""free from the disposition to substitute his personal prejudices for the constitution of the United States."" The advice of"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_17_1	"the aged scholar to the young student entering his career of intellectual research, “ Take care, my son, lest you find what you are looking for,"" is a salutary warning. For the desire to discover some hidden truth and to present it in an interesting and elaborate design drives the scholar and the scientist to the most intricate modes of self-deceit in the selection, rejection, and appraisal of evidence and the processes of reasoning they employ, all conducted, they easily persuade themselves, in the dry light of disinterested science. The practical man, doubtless, carries his suspicion of the intellectual life too far, and scholar and scientist feel themselves able to meet contempt with contempt. How should the ignorant appraise the learned? But when the learned themselves recognise the humour of their processes of system-mongering, and return to a simpler intellectual life, the inkling in the practical man's mind becomes illumination. Psychology performs no greater service than in thus turning the light of comedy upon the pretence of Reason to be Master - or even Freeman in the human household. The main difference between the practical man and the intellectual is that the former doesn't even want to be completely reasonable, while the latter thinks he does but doesn't, and cannot."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_18_0	"This brings us round again to our theme, “How much Law and Order"" does man require of Life? The intellectualist will tell us we can never have too much, that beyond the ground he has reduced to order lies a boundless hinterland for further risk and industry in discovery and cultivation. But this does not answer our inquiry, which is addressed to the process or method of the intellectual life. The idea of precise order is too dominant in our intellectual life. It is not enough that we are engaged in extending order and security over wider tracts of life and thought. There still remains Nature's demand for risk and chance and adventure as desirable on their own account. No doubt every science has its borderland of adventure, but the adventurers are few as compared with the many who spend their time in the intensive cultivation of tracts already well surveyed and broken in. Here, too, civilisation imposes overmuch of safe drudgery and makes too little provision for a dangerous life."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_19_0	"But why, it will be said, this stress on dangerous living? Peace and orderly plenty, with the innumerable little chances and changes of this mortal life, are good enough for us! And as for the intellectual life, science, that introduces ever more exactitude into new fields of knowledge, satisfies all requirements. The answer is that these things do not satisfy. Just as in city life, so in academic life, there remains ""the call of the wild ""-a breaking away from the reign of law. Perhaps we ought to be satisfied with freedom within the law. But we are not. The demands of the creative intelligence, the urge for life, are not directed merely to conquering new kingdoms, in the sense of imposing order upon them. The human mind and the human body need areas of disorder, of risk, caprice, or undirected activity. I once met a sage who told me that he set aside one day each week in which to reverse all the little regularities of work and personal habits that occupied the other six-so as to preserve his freedom. Perhaps this was what God meant by His seventh day of rest-for He was not really tired. But all such use of holidays is a too mechanical device. What is needed is a free margin of disorder around the order of our lives so as not to take ourselves too exactly. It may be (as Wordsworth points out) that within these margins of free living and free thinking some"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_19_1	"hidden qualities may find expression. Burke is seldom counted nowadays among the ""philosophers."" Yet there was deeper philosophy"" in his plea for ""the unbought graces of life"" in an age of ""sophisters, economists, and calculators."" But, perhaps, after all, even this plea for the finer utilities may be an improper concession. It may be better for the unbent mind to play a game of chance as a sacrifice to the Goddess of Unreason."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_20_0	CHAPTER III
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_21_0	THE NEED FOR LIES
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_22_0	"Unless people usually spoke the truth to another society would be impossible. But if they always spoke the truth, it would equally be impossible. Where, then, lies the right economy of truth? The issue is only evaded by distinctions between statements of objective or external facts and statements of private thought or feeling. No doubt it is easier to say what you think about the weather than what you think about the character and conduct of those around you. But there are not a few occasions when we feel justified in concealing or misstating our opinion of the weather. Note that ""we feel justified."" We hold some lies to be not merely harmless, but useful. There is, indeed, something absurd to us in the posing of an extreme case, such as “If a murderer ask you which road his intended victim has taken,"" as though some desperate exception were needed to justify the lie. Concealment or misrepresentation has an accepted place in every phase of our social economy, nay, of our personal economy. Would our life be tolerable if we did not try ""to put the best face on it"" and deceive ourselves as we deceive others? Some persons are franker than others, but all of us are practising deceit from morning to night. So habitual, indeed, has this alloy of falsehood become in every phase of social intercourse, that some are disposed to deny that it is falsehood, on the ground that it does not, in fact, deceive. It"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_22_1	"is only conventional politeness or good manners!__But this is ""rationalising "" the service of falsehood. These social amenities are intended to, and do, deceive, though not precisely in the manner and degree a strict interpretation of the words suggests. Falsehood, in a word, is recognised to have a proper place in the rules and respectabilities of life. Yet children are never taught when to tell a lie and what sort of lie. On the contrary, they are commonly taught that they must always tell the truth, irrespective of consequences either to themselves or others. Why is this? Is it because parents and teachers know that it is so much more difficult to get the requisite amount of truth-telling? Anyhow, this early misteaching, by seeking to attach a sense of sin and shame to all lying, causes a large amount of needless misery to sensitive natures, and sometimes impairs for life the acquisition of the requisite facility for falsehood. Most quick, observant children doubtless soon perceive that parents and teachers fail to observe their own prescriptions, but some damaging confusion must remain as the result of the early authoritative imposition of the supreme falsehood, ""You must always tell the truth.”"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_23_0	"Generally, theory lags behind practice, as law behind custom, but in this recognition of the vital necessity of mixing falsehood with truth, philosophy has now gone far, perhaps too far. For all the sciences are seen to make a conscious use of fictions as tools in their pursuit of truths. Not only the physical sciences, with their atoms, forces, causality, etc., but, most of all, the exactest of the sciences, mathematics, derives its exactness from the bold contradictions of its fundamental fictions, as in geometry the lines and points and circles whose definitions are sheer illogic. The moral sciences, economics, politics, ethics, sociology, are recognised to operate throughout by assumptions which are false and contradictory when tested by strict reason. ""Free will"" in ethics, like ""free"" competition in economics or ""free"" contract in politics, is a conscious invention, justified by the claim that, contrary as it is to the known facts of human conduct, it is useful in the attainment of a social order. So with the numerous analogies and metaphors which figure so prominently in all attempts to put order into mental processes, their virtue is not their truth, but the utility they are held to furnish through blending falsehood with truth. It is not here a matter of anticipating truths and laws by hypothesis with subsequent verification. The scientific fictions are claimed to be deliberate falsehoods, containing this falseness in their very essence, i.e. self-contradictory, to be sloughed off when they have done their work in helping the"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_23_1	scientific mind to discover truths useful for the furtherance of life. Not merely is fiction thus incorporated in the processes of each science, but the work of generalisation itself contains an element of falsehood, as indeed the once famous battle between nominalism and realism disclosed. Language, and the art of thinking associated with it, are composed of images that deliberately misrepresent the concrete facts of Nature, and, what is more, their values for man depend upon this falsification. So the whole conceptual world - the world as imaged in the mind of man - is an elaborate fiction.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_24_0	"That every one of the representative fine arts falsifies the facts in order to attain that beauty which is a higher truth, is an accepted doctrine of aesthetics. It is for that reason that hard, practical men, and their moralists called Puritans, have condemned art. It was not, as is often held, that they hated beauty on its own account (that is a libel of their enemies), but that they hated falsehood, and could not see the high truths art's falsehood was designed to serve. No doubt their hate was primarily due to what they regarded as the degradation of the spiritual truths of religion by material imagery and sensuous appeals. By a natural extension their ban also fell on these same arts applied to secular uses, for was not theirs a jealous God who brooked no rival in His claims upon the spare time and interests of man outside the prescribed day's work for livelihood? What they failed to see was that alike the thought of their theology and its anthropomorphic imagery, the ""spiritual truths"" for whose purity they fought, were the products of this very faculty of artistic falsification they held to be the enemy. The graven images they expelled from the churches were doubtless more material than those stored in their hearts. But the latter were even falser, because painted in softer stuff, vaguer forms, and looser colours, and if thus rendered more mysterious, were not less but more replete with contradictions. For conscious art, applied to"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_24_1	the conception of a spiritual universe, will transcend its false images in some higher harmony (however incomplete), while unconscious art will lose itself in the dogmatic perplexities which it has woven into the false semblance of spiritual verities.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_25_0	"So we perceive that, alike in the arts of conduct, and of thought in science, philosophy, and the fine arts, there emerges the necessity of falsehood to temper truth and help to mould it to the uses of man. Indeed, so fascinating is this justification of the free imagination of man in its revolt against hard law and order, that it is no wonder the showmen of this world of fiction tend in their turn to exaggeration and excess. The presumption still stands in favour of the plain concrete truth of realism. We still do well to ask not ""How much?"" but ""How little ? "" fiction we must employ in the several arts and sciences. Moreover, of fictions may we say with Browning:"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_26_0	"""Well, now: there's nothing in nor out o' the world Good except truth: yet this the Something else, What's this, then, which proves good yet seems untrue? This that I mixed with truth, motives of mine That quickened, made the inertness malleable. O! the gold was not mine. this?"" What's your name for this?"""
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_27_0	Are means to the end in fact themselves an end? Is fiction which makes fact alive fact too?
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_28_0	It is natural enough that a poet here should raise an issue which escapes the harder intelligence of the scientist and philosopher. These fictions which serve as emollients in social conduct, helping men to live and work together harmoniously, to build up language, laws, religions, morals, and all social institutions: which mix with the materials and the movements of the artist in his creative work which furnish direction and tools to the man of science and the philosopher in their tasks of the discovery and ordering of thought-is it just to speak of them as falsehood, because of some internal contradictions they contain ? Are the kinds of fact to which they are false pure truths? Or may they rather be regarded as the other side of the so-called truths which are but half-truths without them? Can any stuff be considered as helping to mould and move other stuff towards some new and higher form unless it has some community of nature with that other stuff? Falsehood that was the sheer contrary, or negation, of truth could exert no such influence as is ascribed to it. Matter, mind; body, spirit; truth, falsehood; these, as all other dualisms, are but convenient halts in the upward movement of the mind towards a unity of law and order that can be never reached, but after which we are perpetually striving. One practical point remains, that in every field and level of conduct, individual or social, practical or intellectual, a modicum of lawlessness, disorder,
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_28_1	risk taking, falsehood, and illogic belongs to the economy of life. The attempt to deny this and refuse it access because it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to measure this modicum, and to prevent excesses, remains alike for politics and morals, for economics, as for the finer arts and processes of thinking, a conservatism which is literally deadly, for it kills the adventurous spirit of man. 21

1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_30_0	ARMS AND MAN
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_31_0	"As disorder and falsehood have their place in the economy of life and conduct, so has physical force. In the spiral of civilisation this place is one of everdiminishing importance. In the arts of industry, mind is constantly displacing muscle; new inventions and better organisation continually reduce the quantity even of inorganic energy that goes into a given product. The modern factory, with its automatic machines controlled by a few skilled engineers, has gone very far towards the elimination of human physical force from industry. So have the locomotive engine and the automobile in transport. The absolute ideal is expressed in ""Touch the button."" But it never is, nor can be, reached. For to the almost negligible force of touching a button or moving a switch must be added a larger reserve force for rare and ever rarer emergencies that call for sudden and considerable effort, not of mind only, but of muscle. If from mechanics we turn to art, we encounter in a more delicate way the same economy. In the fineness of creation or execution, in sculpture, painting, music, the dance, the drama, quality prevails over quantity, the greatest results involving the least expenditure of physical force. And yet, even in the most refined of the arts, the creative work involves at certain times a heavy tax not only upon the nervous but the muscular system - sheer physical strains and stresses."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_32_0	This is evidently applicable to every ordinary art of conduct. However far we go in economising effort by custom and routine, some minimum of effort still remains, and there is always the possibility of some break in the routine, some sudden accident that calls for a reserve of force. It is so in driving a horse, in tending a garden, looking after a child, even in reading a book. If you do these things skilfully the effort will be small, and the small emergencies will be easily met. I chose the last example purposely, for in reading a book one seems to have reduced the element of physical force to something like zero. Yet, as one gets older, the double call, that of constant psycho-physical attention and that of sudden concentration, makes the lesson clear. An angry man, tackling a stiff lock with a rusty key, will put out much force and break the key: the wise man will oil the lock and use gentle pressure, but even his gentleness is a matter of degree. My reason for labouring these platitudes is that their wisdom is lost sight of in a really dangerous way by modern idealists in social and political reform. We have educationalists who pretend that the beautiful nature of a child should be permitted to unfold itself quite freely, or that something called guidance can be conducted with no element of physical restraint. Similarly, reaction against ignorant brutality in the care of criminals, lunatics, and defectives has
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_32_1	taken shape in quasi-scientific or sentimental treatment professing to rely entirely upon moral influences. Christian Science, Higher Thought, and other doctrines of the absolute control of body by the mind, would expel drugs from therapeutics and scrap all the accepted rules of physical hygiene. There is, of course, nothing novel in these attempts of elevated and ascetic thinkers to ignore and to deny the body and the influences of matter in the conduct of life. They are ever-recurrent manifestations of a spiritual pride in the only animal so foolish as to be ashamed of his ancestry and inheritance.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_33_0	It may be said that the animal in man is and will remain quite strong enough to take care of its own interests, and to resent successfully any undue attempt at the supremacy of mind in the regulation of conduct. Any over-spiritual animals will be bred out, or otherwise eliminated. But the trouble is that these fantastic excesses of idealism are serious impediments to urgently needed steps of human advance. They provide reductiones ad absurdum to every enemy of progress. Let me illustrate from a wider field of human conduct. The greatest single peril to the progress of man, to the safety of civilisation, is war, and the minds of thoughtful men and women are bent upon schemes for getting rid of war. A quite simple proposition, says an absolutist. If there were no arms there could be no war. Let nations, therefore, agree to disarm and to submit all matters of dispute to judicial or arbitral settlement. Courts for international settlement will need no force behind their judgments; the public opinion of the world will suffice. Now it is conceivable that some nations might disarm, if they had full confidence that every likely enemy would obey the award of the court when it went against him. But would all nations have this confidence, and would they be justified in a faith which has the whole of past experience against it? The proposal, therefore, to put no international force behind the international court of justice will simply mean that effective
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_33_1	national disarmament will not take place. In order to disarm individuals in a community and to put down group-fighting, public courts of justice are established with the requisite amount of physical force to back public opinion in securing the execution of the courts' decrees. Why should it seem reasonable to put international courts at once upon a higher plane of morals, and to presume moral force capable of dispensing altogether with armed force?
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_34_0	The only result of the absolutist attitude is to render national disarmament impossible. It is at least significant that the militarist sections of every nation stand side by side with extreme pacifists in refusing to put an international force at the disposal of the Court or League of Nations. Force can be made a means of justice. Upon this truth society is built. Force applied selfishly by individuals or sections is bad. Force applied socially by organised society is good. Internationalism simply applies this same economy of force on a higher level. There will be less force used, and it will be used in the cause of justice and not of injustice. National armaments must yield place to international. Public opinion cannot be mobilised so speedily, so strongly, and so wisely as to dispense with an international police. The attempt to do this will simply leave large national armaments in being, and weaken the reliance upon international Court or Council. No reliable peace for the world can be won by a false overestimate of public opinion.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_35_0	"No-force pacifism contains a double error. For how does it check the movement towards disarmament ? It relies upon an ultimately false antithesis between physical and moral force. Public opinion, even when in substance sound, and operated in the cause of justice, is often as brutal and as cruel in crushing opposition as the cruder forms of violence it purports to displace. Indeed, any close psychological analysis discloses the facts (1) that public opinion commonly incorporates elements of definitely physical force, and (2) that its appeal to reason and good feeling is driven home by the bludgeon of authority in ways at least as degrading to humanity as the simpler modes of coercion. Corruptio optimi pessima. ""Yes,"" it may be replied, ""but the public opinion in question will be the enlightened will of all the peoples, informed and nourished by the equity and wisdom of known and trusted judges."" An admirable ideal, gradually approachable! But now? Do the peoples now possess that full faith in the justice and wisdom of foreigners (there's the rub) needed for the present working of this internationalism? Are they sure that they, and all the other nations, will accept and obey the Court or Council on issues which are held to be of vital interest to their safety or honour? If so, the millennium is nearer than I think. Sound courts of justice expressing an international will are not enough. It is upon a reasonable faith in an enlightened, steady, incorruptible public opinion that no-force"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_35_1	"pacifism must rely for the safety of an unarmed world. Now, does the public opinion even of the educated classes in every, or any, nation satisfy this test? ""Not completely,"" it will be said, ""but hold up the banner of the ideal and the rest will advance most rapidly to fulfilment."" A possible economy, provided it does not lead its exponents to deny the risk their policy involves. What is that risk? Not the failure of an unarmed world-order to maintain itself. Rather the failure of nations to disarm, because they do not possess the requisite amount of faith in the moral sanction of public opinion for the fulfilment of the decrees of international justice. The fallacy of pacific absolutism will thus be registered in terms of competing national armaments and menaces of war."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_36_0	There is a single philosophic fallacy underlying all the perfectionist codes. They all mistake the antithetic dualisms of order and disorder, truth and falsehood, spirit and matter, force and reason, for ultimate and absolute distinctions, whereas they are only conveniences for the conduct of life. Couples so intimate in their relations, always found in company, always acting upon one another, may seem to the casual spectator to be quarrelling. But they are of the same flesh and blood, of the same spirit, otherwise you would not find them in such intimate relations. Perhaps it is an improper sublimation of the fighting instinct which leads so many pacifists to stress and dramatise a conflict between physical and moral force which is nothing but a lovers' quarrel, when seen sub specie aeternitatis.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_37_0	CHAPTER V
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_38_0	THE NEED FOR HUMOUR
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_39_0	"Bergson hit upon a serviceable half-truth when he made laughter turn upon the behaviour of a human being as if he were a machine. The scholar, philosopher, or professionalist who brings the severe logic or the formulas of his special branch of learning to bear upon some ordinary situation in practical affairs cuts a ridiculous figure. Why? Because he is essentially unequal to the occasion. He is the exponent of an intellectual routine that must always lag behind the requirements of the present. His weight of learning, logic, procedure, cramp his liberty for handling a new situation in ordinary life. ""Mathematics,"" remarked Oliver Wendell Holmes, ""breeds a despotic way of thinking."" This applies to every scientist in proportion as his science is ""exact."" The professor in politics has always been a byword—an essentially comic figure out of place, bringing into the discussion and settlement of human problems the method and temper appropriate to measurable and reliable material. Even if his specialism falls outside the exact sciences, belonging to the humanities, the burden of precedent, which large acquaintance with the past secretly imposes, quite visibly impairs his agility and willingness to take risks. His truisms tend to conservatism, because they cannot help exaggerating the extent to which history repeats itself. It is to the historian that we look for the most frequent utterance of a false determinism in the judgments that begin ""Human nature being what it is"" and ""The whole course of history teach Pride of intellectual property constantly impels"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_39_1	to this statical view of human conduct. Even great men of science commonly concern themselves over-much with the codification of their laws, neglecting the cutting edge of science in its more hazardous excursions into the hinterlands of knowledge. I have already touched upon the fallacy of system-mongering and the aesthetic and property instincts that impel towards the practice. But here it is the comedy of such procedure that interests us. Great system-mongers, like Comte, Bentham, Spencer, are engaged in being comic upon the largest possible scale, i.e. putting the whole creative process of man and the universe under the fetters of formula. They do precisely what Molière's pedant, lawyer, or doctor does when he automatically applies his jargon and treatment to cases where they have no relevance. Our philosopher, scientist, historian are right in holding that the future will resemble the past in large measure. Where they err is in failing to realise that the bit of the future which does not resemble the past is for that very reason the most interesting and important part. It is always the discontinuous, the novel, the breach of the rule, that fastens itself upon us as spectators and actors in the human drama. So far as we are scientists, or can handle the elaborate routine of life by rules of thumb or thought, all goes smoothly. But the variants, the novelties, the cases where experience is dumb, these call for the artist-or the gambler. For if you haven't got the creative instinct
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_39_2	"with some skilled aptitude for handling the novel, life is for you nothing but a gamble, a game of chance"" just one damned thing after another!"" If you possess this instinct and this aptitude, you may be said to be an artist. For it belongs to the artist to handle new opportunities in a creative way. But what sort of artist? A Philosopher? I think I think not. He has too heavy a hand for the job. Shall we say a Humorist ?"
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_40_0	It is a pity that this word has been so narrowed and degraded from its Elizabethan use that Jonson would scarcely recognise it. And yet perhaps its modern meaning still retains a necessary ingredient for the artist of life. For the true humorist is not the mere spectator some pretend, laughing, however good-naturedly, at the queernesses and follies of the great mundane process. He can take a hand himself in life, and, by virtue of his keenness and imaginative sympathy, help to convert a game of chance into a game of skill. The contemplative attitude of a Montaigne does not fill the rôle. To extract the richest humour out of life, one must experiment as well as observe. Especially must one experiment with oneself, the richest and most reliable material at hand. This explains why, upon the whole, we prefer the title humorist to that of humanist, which to many may seem better accredited to the part. It carries certain qualities of verve and lightness-I had almost said levity-needed for the perception and the handling of novelty and opportunity. The associations of humanism are a little overserious for the art. Knowledge is taken by its devotees a little too gravely. It does not do to be over-steeped in culture. It will hardly leave you spry enough to handle quick, unforeseen occurrences.
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_41_0	"If, however, it be felt that a humorist is too much identified with the comic spirit, we may at least insist that humour is the first and most general requisite for the artist in life. Whenever the tension of routine is broken, whenever the unexpected happens, or history fails to repeat itself, anger, fear, admiration, pity, or disgust may overwhelm all other emotions at the spectacle. But where none of these emotions prevails, humour steps in and asserts a reversionary right. The sudden contrast which its discontinuity, its incongruity, presents, the element of surprise, are an assertion of the creative in the phenomenal process, and bring into sympathetic action the creative intelligence in man. Our first reaction to it is a play of humour which perceives a "" happy thought,"" a quaintness of behaviour, a strange event-something surprising which we must take into account and handle with interest and skill, as lying outside the safer low-grade thought and feeling with which we carry on our routine life. Things that "" happen"" make us "" happy not merely in the sense that we are interested spectators, but because they take us out of a groove and supply us with the material for free creative activity. To deal with things that ""happen "" we exercise intelligence, initiative, and ingenuity, and by helping to make things happen, launch ourselves on the creative current of life."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_42_0	"But if things are ""happening"" all the time, the rush overwhelms us and paralyses intelligent activity. We need, then, a safe, steady background of law and order where happenings are so small as not to count. So once more, by a slightly different road, we return to our prime economy of compromise."
1-14-notes-law-order	doc_12_43_0	"Happiness consists perhaps in a general sense of wellbeing derived from the smooth rhythm of an orderly life, with occasional swift excursions into fields of adventure where the creative impulse may enjoy itself. This general sense of well-being"" is rooted in social order. The creative impulse is the individual's break away, usually consumed in personal enjoyment, but sometimes sowing seeds of fruitful change within the social order."
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_0_0	PREFACE
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_1_0	These chapters are the fruit of a brief visit to Russia in September 1925 by one ignorant of the language and of the country, but not without experience of the people, and in the company of an interpreter. ‘The occasion was found in the bicentenary celebrations of the Academy of Sciences, once the Imperial Academy of Petersburg, now of Leningrad, at which I represented the University of Cambridge.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_2_0	They are not based on intimate knowledge or close experience, and claim no authority as such. They are merely the impressions, for what they are worth, of an observer, whose prejudices were not specially calculated to distort his sight, endeavouring to convey, as best he can, how Russia struck him.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_3_0	I use not infrequently in what follows the epithet religious as applicable to the disciples of Lenin. Judging from letters which I received when these chapters were appearing in the Nation, I believe that Englishmen will see what I mean; but in Russia there will be few, I gather, who will approve or understand this use of language. To the Bolshevists themselves the word will sound as stupid and offensive, mere vulgar abuse—as though I were to call the Archbishop of Canterbury a bolshevist (which, however, he may indeed deserve, if he seriously pursues the Gospel precepts); for they claim to be just the opposite. Religion, mysticism, idealism— it is part of the Leninist’s creed that all such matters are trumpery and trash, whereas they themselves are materialists, realists, of the earth earthy. Have they not, but the other day, ordained that in the libraries of the proletarian clubs “ the section on religion must contain solely anti-religious literature ” ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_4_0	There may be good reasons out of the past why religion should have a nasty taste in Russian mouths. ‘There Lo be a consistent and intelligible use of language by which High Church mystics are alone religious and those who try to find a better path on earth are irreligious, by which the cries of dancing dervishes are religious and the Sermon on the Mount irreligious, by which Rasputin was religious and Tolstoy irreligious. Let me, therefore, explain in advance that, when I say that Leninism may be inspired with religious fervour, I do not suggest that the Commissars are High Church mystics, dancing dervishes or Rasputins in mufti.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_5_0	To English readers these explanations are probably not needed. For here we have long recognised that there are two branches of religion — high and low, mystical sleep-walkers and practical idealists. There are two distinct sublimations of materialistic egotism — one in which the ego is merged in the nameless mystic union, another in in which it is merged in the pursuit of an ideal life for the whole community of men. The participants of the first may neglect or ignore the second ; many followers of the second contemn what seems to them the idle indulgence or self-deceptions of the first. It has been the peculiarity of some great religious leaders that they have belonged to both classes at once. At any rate, when I speak of religion I include both, and not the former only.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_6_0	Some instances from our latter-day celebrities may illustrate my explanation. Certain of the politicians of France, M. Poincaré, for example, followed hard by some of the politicians of the United States, seem to me to be amongst the most irreligious men now in the world ; Trotsky, Mr Bernard Shaw, and Mr Baldwin, each in his way, amongst the most religious. I do not forget that Trotsky has written :
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_7_0	“To accept the Workers’ Revolution in the name of a high ideal means not only to reject it, but to slander it. All the social illusions which mankind has raved about in religion, poetry, morals, or philosophy, served only the purpose of deceiving and blinding the oppressed. The Socialist Revolution tears the cover off ‘illusions,’ off ‘elevating,’ as well as off humiliating deceptions, and washes off in blood reality’s make-up. The Revolution is strong to the extent to which it is realistic, rational, strategic, and mathematical. Can it be that the Revolution, the same one which is now before us, the first since the earth began, needs the seasoning of romantic outbursts, as a cat ragout needs hare sauce ?”
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_8_0	For he has also looked forward to “a society which will have thrown off the pinching and stultifying worry about one’s daily bread . . . in which the liberated egotism of man—a mighty force !—will be directed wholly towards the understanding, the transformation, and the betterment of the Universe.” ‘Trotsky himself does not confuse the means with the end:
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_9_0	“The Revolution itself is not yet the Kingdom of Freedom. On the contrary, it is developing the features of ‘necessity ’ to the greatest degree. ... Revolutionary literature cannot but be imbued with a spirit of social hatred, which is a creative historic factor in the epoch of proletarian dictatorship. But under Socialism solidarity will be the basis of society. Literature and Art will be tuned to a different key. All the emotions which we revolutionaries, at the present time, feel apprehensive of naming —so much have they been worn thin by hypocrites and vulgarians—such as disinterested friendship, love for one’s neighbour, sympathy, will be the mighty ringing chords of Socialist poetry.”
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_10_0	One has a feeling that such sentiments would not come with equal sincerity or seriousness or emotional force from the lips, for example, of Signor Mussolini or President Calvin Coolidge. The Duce may be a rake susceptible of being reformed, and the President a respectable person whose salvation is out of the question. What are they really? I cannot certainly say;— the matters, which are often palpable at close quarters, hard to distinguish at a distance. Before I went to Russia I was in similar doubts about the Communists. What I thought I learnt on the spot and could not have learnt elsewhere, is a partial answer. :

1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_15_0	CHAPTER I
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_16_0	WHAT IS THE COMMUNIST FAITH ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_17_0	It is extraordinarily difficult to be fair-minded about Russia. And even with fair-mindedness, how is a true impression to be conveyed of something so unfamiliar, shifting, and contradictory, of which no one in England has a background of knowledge or experience? No English newspaper has a regular correspondent resident in Russia. We rightly attach small credence to what the Soviet authorities say about themselves. Most of our news is from prejudiced Labour deputations or from prejudiced émigrés. Thus a belt of fog separates us from what goes on in the other world where the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics rules and experiments and evolves a kind of order. Russia is suffering the penalty of years of “propaganda,” which, by taking away credence from words, almost destroys, in the end, the means of communication at a distance.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_18_0	Leninism is a combination of two things which Europeans have kept for some centuries in different compartments of the soul — religion and business. We are shocked because the religion is new, and contemptuous because the business, being subordinated to the religion instead of the other way round, is highly inefficient.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_19_0	Like other new religions, Leninism derives its power not from the multitude but from a small minority of enthusiastic converts, whose zeal and intolerance make each one the equal in strength of a hundred indifferentists. Like other new religions, it is led by those who can combine the new spirit, perhaps sincerely, with seeing a good deal more than their followers, politicians with at least an average dose of political cynicism, who can smile as well as frown, volatile experimentalists, released by religion from truth and mercy but not blinded to facts and expediency, and open therefore to the charge (superficial and useless though it is where politicians, lay or ecclesiastical, are concerned) of hypocrisy. Like other new religions, it seems to take the colour and galety and freedom out of everyday life and to offer a drab substitute in the square wooden faces of its devotees. Like other new religions, it persecutes without justice or pity those who actively resist it. Like other new religions, it is unscrupulous. Like other new religions, it is filled with missionary ardour and cecumenical ambitions. But to say that Leninism is the faith of a persecuting and propagating minority of fanatics led by hypocrites is, after all, to say no more nor less than that it is a religion and not merely a party, and Lenin a Mahomet, not a Bismarck. If we want to frighten ourselves in our capitalist easy-chairs, we can picture the Communists of Russia as though the early Christians
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_19_1	led by Attila were using the equipment of the Holy Inquisition and: the Jesuit missions to enforce the literal economics of the New Testament ; but when we want to comfort ourselves in the same chairs, can we hopefully repeat that these economics are fortunately so contrary to human nature that they cannot finance either missionaries or armies and will surely end in defeat ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_20_0	There are three questions to answer. Is the new religion partly true, or sympathetic to the souls of modern men? Is it on the material side so inefficient as to render it incapable to survive? Will it, in the course of time, with sufficient dilution and added impurity, catch the multitude ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_21_0	As for the first question, those who are completely satisfied by Christian capitalism or by egotistic capitalism untempered by subterfuge will not hesitate how to answer it; for they either have a religion or need none. But many, in this age without religion, are bound to feel a strong emotional curiosity towards any religion which is really new and not merely a recrudescence of old ones and has proved its motive force ; and all the more when the new thing comes out of Russia, the beautiful and foolish youngest son of the European family, with hair on his head, nearer both to the earth and to heaven than his bald brothers in the West — who, having been born two centuries later, has been able to pick up the middleaged disillusionment of the rest of the family before he has lost the genius of youth or become addicted to comfort and to habits. I sympathise with those who seek for something good in Soviet Russia.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_22_0	But when we come to the actual thing, what is one to say? For me, brought up ina free air undarkened by the horrors of religion, with nothing to be afraid of, Red Russia holds too much which is detestable. Comfort and habits let us be ready to forgo, but I am not ready for a creed which does not care how much it destroys the liberty and security of daily life, which uses deliberately the weapons of persecution, destruction, and international strife. How can I admire a policy which finds a characteristic expression in spending millions to suborn spies in every family and group at home, and to stir up trouble abroad? Perhaps this is no worse and has more purpose than the greedy, warlike, and imperialist propensities of other Governments; but it must be far better than these to shift me out of my rut. How can I accept a doctrine which sets up as its bible, above and beyond criticism, an obsolete economic textbook which I know to be not only scientifically erroneous but without interest or application for the modern world ? How can I adopt a creed which, preferring the mud to the fish exalts the boorish proletariat above the bourgeois and the intelligentsia who, with whatever faults, are the quality in life and surely carry the seeds of all human advancement ? Even if we need a religion, how can we find it in the turbid rubbish of the red bookshops? It is hard
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_22_1	for an educated, decent, intelligent son of Western Europe to find his ideals here, unless he has first suffered some strange and horrid process of conversion which has changed all his values.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_23_0	Yet we shall miss the essence of the new religion if we stop at this point. The Communist may justly reply that all these things belong not to his ultimate Faith but to the tactics of Revolution. For he believes in two things: the introduction of a New Order upon earth, and the method of the Revolution as the only means thereto. The New Order must not be judged either by the horrors of the Revolution or by the privations of the transitionary period. The Revolution is to be a supreme example of the means justified by the end. The soldier of the Revolution must crucify his own human nature, becoming unscrupulous and ruthless, and suffering himself a life without security or joy—but as the means to his purpose and not its end.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_24_0	What, then, is the essence of the new religion as a New Order upon earth? Looking from outside, I do not clearly know. Sometimes its mouthpieces speak as though it was purely materialistic and technical in just the same sense that modern capitalism is — as though, that is to say, Communism merely claimed to be in the long run a superior technical instrument for obtaining the same materialistic economic benefits as capitalism offers, that in time it will cause the fields to yield more and the forces of Nature to be more straitly harnessed. In this case there is no religion after all, nothing but a bluff to facilitate a change to what may or may not be a better economic technique. But I suspect that, in fact, such talk is largeley a reaction against the charges of economic inefficiency which we on our side launch, and that at the heart of Russian Communism there is something else of more concern to mankind.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_25_0	In one respect Communism but follows other famous religions. It exalts the common man and makes him everything. Here there is nothing new. But there is another factor in it which also is not new but which may, nevertheless, in a changed form and a new setting, contribute something to the true religion of the future, if there be any true religion. Leninism is absolutely, defiantly non-supernatural, and its emotional and ethical essence centres about the individual’s and the community’s attitude towards the Love of Money.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_26_0	I do not mean that Russian Communism alters, or even seeks to alter, human nature, that it makes Jews less avaricious or Russians less extravagant than they were before. I do not merely mean that it sets up a new ideal. I mean that it tries to construct a framework of society in which pecuniary motives as influencing action shall have a changed relative importance, in which social approbations shall be differently distributed, and where behaviour, which previously was normal and respectable, ceases to be either the one or the other.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_27_0	In England to-day a talented and virtuous youth, about to enter the world, will balance the advantages of entering the Civil Service and of seeking a fortune in business ; and public opinion will esteem him not less if he prefers the second. Money-making, as such, on as large a scale as possible, is not less respectable socially, perhaps more so, than a life devoted to the service of the State or of Religion, Education, Learning, or Art. But in the Russia of the future it is intended that the career of money-making, as such, will simply not occur to a respectable young man as a possible opening, any more than the career of a gentleman burglar or acquiring skill in forgery and embezzlement. Even the most admirable aspects of the love of money in our existing society, such as thrift and saving, and the attainment of financial security and independence for one’s self and one’s family, whilst not deemed morally wrong, will be rendered so difficult and impracticable as to be not worth while. Everyone should work for the community — the new creed runs — and, if he does his duty, the community will uphold him.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_28_0	This system does not mean a complete levelling down of incomes—at least at the present stage. A clever and successful person in Soviet Russia has a bigger income and a better time than other people. The commissar with £5 a week (plus sundry free services, a motor-car, a flat, a box at the ballet, etc., etc.) lives well enough, but not in the least like a rich man in London. The successful professor or civil servant with £6 or £7 a week (minus sundry impositions) has, perhaps, a real income three times those of the proletarian workers and six times those of the poorer peasants. Some peasants are three or four times richer than others. A man who is out of work receives part pay, not full pay. But no one can afford on these incomes, with high Russian Prices and stiff progressive taxes, to save anything worth Saving ; it is hard enough to live day by day. The progressive taxation and the mode of assessing rents and other charges are such that it is actually disadvantageous to have an acknowledged income exceeding £8 to £10 a week. Nor is there any possibility of large gains except by taking the same sort of risks as attach to bribery and embezzlement elsewher — not that bribery and embezzlement have disappeared in Russia or are even rare, but anyone whose extravagance or whose instincts drive him to such courses runs serious risk of detection and penalties which include death.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_29_0	Nor, at the present stage, does the system involve the actual prohibition of buying and selling at a profit. The policy is not to forbid these professions, but to render them precarious and disgraceful. The private trader is a sort of permitted outlaw, without privileges or protection, like the Jew in the Middle Ages—an outlet for those who have overwhelming instincts in this direction, but not a natural or agreeable job for the normal man.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_30_0	The effect of these social changes has been, I think, to make a real change in the predominant attitude towards money, and will probably make a far greater change when a new generation has grown up which has known nothing else. People in Russia, if only because of their poverty, are very greedy for money—at least as greedy as elsewhere. But money-making and moneyaccumulating cannot enter into the life-calculations of a rational man who accepts the Soviet rule in the way in which they enter into ours. A Society, of which this is even partially true, is a tremendous innovation.

But is it appropriate to assume, as most of us have assumed hitherto, that it is insincere or wicked ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_32_0	CHAPTER II
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_33_0	THE ECONOMICS OF SOVIET RUSSIA
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_34_0	We shall not understand Leninism unless we view it as being at the same time a persecuting and missionary religion and an experimental economic technique. What of the second aspect — Is the economic technique so inefficient that it courts disaster ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_35_0	The economic system of Soviet Russia has undergone and is undergoing such rapid changes that it is impossible to obtain a precise and accurate account of it. The method of trial-and-error is unreservedly employed. No one has ever been more frankly experimentalist than Lenin was in everything which did not touch the central truths of his Faith. At first there was much confusion as to what was essential and what not. For example, the doctrine held at the outset that money must be abolished for most purposes is now seen to be erroneous, there being nothing inconsistent with the essence of Communism in continuing to use money as an instrument of distribution and calculation. The Government has also come round to the view that it is wiser to combine a policy of limited toleration with intermittent teasing and harrying towards (for example) the old intelligentsia who have stuck to their country, towards private traders, and even towards foreign capitalists, rather than to attempt to crush out these elements altogether—trusting on the one hand to the complete control of the educational machine and the upbringing of the young, and on the other hand to the gradual improvement of the technique of State trading and to the growth of State apa to dispense with these pagan auxiliaries in course of time. Thus almost all the members of the non-Communist intelligentsia with prewar educations are now in the service of the Government, often in important and responsible posts with relatively high salaries; private
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_35_1	trade is again lawful, though precarious and difficult ; and foreign capitalists, who grant short-period trade credits against Government imports into Russia, can reckon for the present with some certainty, in my opinion, that they will see their money back in due course. The fluctuating pursuits of these expediencies make it difficult to generalise about anything in Soviet Russia. Almost everything one can say about the country is true and false at the same time —which is the reason why friendly and hostile critics can each in good faith produce totally different pictures of the same thing.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_36_0	A further difficulty in estimating the efficiency of the economic system is caused by the hard material conditions attending its earlier years, which would have tried severely any economic system. The material losses and disorganisation of the Great War were followed by those of a succession of civil wars, by outlawry from the rest of the world, and by several bad harvests. The bad harvests were partly due to bad management as well as to bad luck. Nevertheless the Soviet experimentalists can fairly claim, I think, that at least five years of peace and fair weather must elapse before they can be judged merely by results.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_37_0	If one is to make any generalisation in present conditions, it must be this—that at a low level of efficiency the system does function and possesses elements of permanence. I estimate the truth about the economic condition of Russia in its present phase to be roughly as follows.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_38_0	Russia is now a country of about 140,000,000 inhabitants, of whom six-sevenths are rural and agricultural in their life and one-seventh is urban and industrial. The urban and industrial population, which is what the casual visitor sees, is not self-supporting — it lives, that is to say, at a standard of life which is higher than its output justifies. ‘This excess expenditure on the part of the town population is covered by the exploitation of the peasant, which is only practicable because the town population is a numerically small proportion of the whole country. Thus the Communist Government is able to pamper (comparatively speaking) the proletarian worker, who is of course its especial care, by exploiting the peasant ; whilst the peasant, in spite of this exploitation, desires no change of Government, because he has been given his land. In this way a certain equilibrium has been established both in the economic sphere and in the political, which gives the Soviet Government a breathing space in which to try its hand at a serious economic reorganisation. :
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_39_0	"The official method of exploiting the peasants is not so much by taxation — though the land tax is an important item in the budget — as by price policy. The monopoly of import and export trade and the virtual control of industrial output enable the authorities to maintain relative prices at levels highly disadvantageous to the peasant. They buy his wheat from him much below the world price, and they sell to him textile and other manufactured goods appreciably above the world price,"" the difference providing a fund out of which can be financed their high overhead costs and the general inefficiency of manufacture and distribution. ‘The monopoly of import and export trade, by permitting a divorce between the internal and external price-levels, can be operated in such a way as to maintain the parity of foreign exchange in spite of a depreciation in the purchasing power of the money. ‘The real value of the rouble inside Russia is, admittedly, much depreciated compared with its external value as measured by the current exchange."
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_40_0	These devices, though effective for their purpose at present, and perhaps inevitable for a time, involve two disastrous factors of inefficiency. The low value of agricultural products in terms of industrial products is a serious deterrent to the output of the former, which is the real wealth of the country. The fundamental problem of the Soviet Government is to get itself into a sufficiently strong financial position to be able to pay the peasant more nearly the real value of his produce—which would surely have the effect of giving him both the means and the incentive to a far higher output. Meanwhile the pampering of the proletarian workers of the towns, whose real incomes are something like double those of the peasants, and are said to have reached, allowing for everything, nearly 80 per cent. of their pre-war level, renders town life far too attractive in comparison with country life. ‘The stimulus to migration from the country to the town is much greater than is justified by the power of industry, with its impaired equipment and deficiency of working capital, to absorb new workers. Nothing would stop the migration, if it were not for the housing difficulties and the lack of employment now offering in the towns—a peasant arriving at Moscow is notified at the station that he can find neither work nor lodging. But these deterrents are only effective after the towns have become overcrowded and unemployment has reached unheard-of proportions. For two years unemployment has been severe and
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_40_1	increasing, and I believe that by now from 20 to 25 per cent of the industrial workers of Russia are unemployed—say 1,500,000 men out of a total of 6,000,000. Some Sart not all of these men receive from their trade a dole representing about a third of their normal wages, which, even so, is not much inferior to the working income of the poorer peasants, with the result that this vast army of unemployed is a heavy burden on the financial resources of the State establishments. This condition of affairs serves but to enforce a lesson of bourgeois economics as being equally applicable in a Communist State, namely, that it impairs wealth to interfere with the normal levels of relative prices or with the normal levels of relative wages so as to make some occupations unduly attractive as compared with others. But it also teaches that similar evils can arise in totally different conditions from totally different causes ; for the Russian problem of relative wages and relative prices out-of-gear is partly the same as ours.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_41_0	Thus the real income of the Russian peasant is not much more than half what it used to be, whilst the Russian industrial worker suffers overcrowding and unemployment as never before. Nevertheless there is, beyond doubt, a certain measure of political and economic stability. “The Soviet State is mot so inefficient as to be unable to survive. It has lived through much worse times than the present. It has established an organisation, covering all the activities of economic life, which is ineficient on normal standards, but which has been evolved out of chaos and the void, yet does exist and function. It has set up a standard of life, which is low compared with ours, but which has been evolved out of starvation and death, yet does provide some comforts. Everyone agrees that-the improvement in the last year is enormous. ‘This year’s harvest is tolerably good. Conditions are manifestly on the up-grade. Some of the grandiose schemes of the new régime are beginning to take actual shape. Leningrad will soon be supplied with power and light from one of the largest and most modern generating stations in the world. The plant-breeding establishments, which are to supply the peasant with better seeds on the latest Mendelian lines, are extensive and well-equipped.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_42_0	After a long debate with Zinovieff, two Communist ironsides who attended him stepped forward to speak to me a last word with the full faith of fanaticism in their eyes. “We make you a prophecy,” they said. ‘ Ten years hence the level of life in Russia will be higher than it was before the war, and in the rest of Europe it will be lower than it was before the war.” Having regard to the natural wealth of Russia and to the inefficiency of the old régime, having regard also to the problems of Western Europe and our apparent inability to handle them, can we feel confident that the comrades will not prove right ?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_43_0	CHAPTER III COMMUNISM’S POWER TO SURVIVE
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_44_0	My third question is not yet answered. Can Communism in the course of time, with sufficient dilution and added impurity, catch the multitude?
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_45_0	I cannot answer what only time will show. But I feel confident of one conclusion—that if Communism achieves a certain success, it will achieve it, not as an improved economic technique, but as a religion. The tendency of our conventional criticisms is to make two opposed mistakes. We hate Communism so much, regarded as a religion, that we exaggerate its economic inefficiency ; and we are so much impressed by its economic inefficiency that we underestimate it as a religion.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_46_0	On the economic side I cannot perceive that Russian Communism has made any contribution to our economic problems of intellectual interest or scientific value. I do not think that it contains, or is likely to contain, any piece of useful economic technique which we could not apply, if we chose, with equal or greater success in a society which retained all the marks, I will not say of nineteenthcentury individualistic capitalism, but of British bourgeois ideals. Theoretically at least, I do not believe that there is any economic improvement for which Revolution is a necessary instrument. On the other hand, we have everything to lose by the methods of violent change. In Western industrial conditions the tactics of Red Revolution would throw the whole population into a pit of poverty of and death.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_47_0	But as a religion what are its forces? Perhaps they are considerable, The exaltation of the common man is a dogma which has caught the multitude before now. Any religion and the bond which unites co-religionists have power against the egotistic atomism of the irreligious.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_48_0	For modern capitalism is absolutely irreligious, without internal union, without much public spirit, often, though not always, a mere congeries of possessors and pursuers. Such a system has to be immensely, not merely moderately, successful to survive. In the nineteenth century it was in a certain sense idealistic ; at any rate it was a united and self-confident system. It was not only immensely successful, but held out hopes of a continuing crescendo of prospective successes. “To-day it is only moderately successful. If irreligious Capitalism is ultimately to defeat religious Communism it is not enough that it should be economically more efficient — it must be many times as efficient.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_49_0	We used to believe that modern capitalism was capable, not merely of maintaining the existing standards of life, but of leading us gradually into an economic paradise where we should be comparatively free from economic cares. Now we doubt whether the business man is leading us to a destination far better than our present place. Regarded as a means he is tolerable; regarded as an end he is not so satisfactory. One begins to wonder whether the material advantages of keeping business and religion in different compartments are sufficient to balance the moral disadvantages. The Protestant and Puritan could separate them comfortably because the first activity pertained to earth and the second to heaven, which was elsewhere. ‘The believer in progress could separate them comfortably because he regarded the first as the means , to the establishment of heaven upon earth hereafter. But there is a third state of mind, in which we do not fully believe either in a heaven which is elsewhere or in progress .as a sure means towards a heaven upon earth hereafter ; and if heaven is not elsewhere and not hereafter, it must be here and now or not at all. If there is no moral objective in economic progress, then it follows that we must not sacrifice, even for a day, moral to material advantage — in other words, that we may no longer keep business and religion in separate compartments of the soul. In so far as a man’s thoughts are capable
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_49_1	of straying along these paths, he will be ready to search with curiosity for something at the heart of Communism quite different from the picture of its outward parts which our Press paints,
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_50_0	At any rate to me it seems clearer every day that the moral problem of our age is concerned with the love of money, with the habitual appeal to the money motive in nine-tenths of the activities of life, with the universal striving after individual economic security as the prime object of endeavour, with the social approbation of money as the measure of constructive success, and with the social appeal to the hoarding instinct as the foundation of the necessary provision for the family and for the future. The decaying religions around us, which have less and less interest for most people unless it be as an agreeable form of magical ceremonial or of social observance, have lost their moral significance just because — unlike some of their earlier versions — they do not touch in the least degree on these essential matters. A revolution in our ways of thinking and feeling about money may become the growing purpose of contemporary embodiments of the ideal. Perhaps, therefore, Russian Communism does represent the first confused stirrings of a great religion.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_51_0	The visitor to Russia from the outside, who tries without prejudice to catch the atmosphere, must alternate, I think, between two moods — oppression and elation. Sir Martin Conway, in his true and sincere volume on Art Treasures in Soviet Russia, writes thus of his departure out of the country :
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_52_0	“... After a very long halt the train moved on about half a mile to the Finnish frontier, where passports, visas, and luggage were again examined much less meticulously. The station was new built, a pleasant place, simple, clean, and convenient, and served with much courtesy. It has a charming refreshment room, where simple but nicely cooked food was supplied in an atmosphere of hospitality.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_53_0	“It seems a churlish thing for me to say, after all the kindness shown to me in Russia, but if I am to tell the whole truth I must here put on record that in this frontier station of Finland I experienced a sense as of the removal of a great weight, which had been oppressing me. I cafnot explain just how this weight had been felt. I did not experience the imposition of it on entering Russia, but as the days passed it seemed slowly to accumulate. The sense of freedom gradually disappeared. Though everyone was kind one felt the presence of an oppression, not on oneself, but all-pervading. Never have I felt so completely a stranger in a strange land ; with successive days what at first was a dim feeling took more definite shape and condensed into an ever-increasingly conscious oppression, I imagine one might have passed through the same experience in the Russia of the Tsars. Americans often praise what they call the ‘air of liberty’ which they claim as characteristic of their country. They possess it in common with all the English-speaking dominions. The moral atmosphere of Russia is a very different compound of emotional chemistry.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_54_0	“The part of Finland through which our train now bore us was not different in physical character from the lands across the frontier, but we found ourselves passing ‘ nice little properties’ and the signs of comfort and even prosperity. . . .”
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_55_0	The mood of oppression could not be better conveyed. In part, no doubt, it is the fruit of Red Revolution — there is much in Russia to make one pray that one’s own country may achieve its goal not in that way. In part, perhaps, it is the fruit of some beastliness in the Russian nature — or in the Russian and Jewish natures when, as now, they are allied together. But in part it is one face of the superb earnestness of Red Russia, of the high seriousness, which in its other aspect appears as the Spirit of Elation. ‘There never was anyone so serious as the Russian of the Revolution, serious even in his gaiety and abandon of spirit — so serious that sometimes he can forget to-morrow and sometimes he can forget to-day. Often this seriousness is crude and stupid and boring in the extreme. ‘The average Communist is discoloured just as the Methodists of every age have been. The tenseness of the atmosphere is more than one is used to support, and a longing comes for the frivolous ease of London.
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_56_0	Yet the elation, when that is felt, is very great. Here — one feels at moments — in spite of poverty, stupidity, and oppression, is the Laboratory of Life. Here the chemicals are being mixed in new combinations, and stink and explode. Something — there is just a chance — might come out. And even a chance gives to what is happening in Russia more importance than what is happening (let us say) in the United States of America, I think that it is partly reasonable to be afraid of Russia, like the gentlemen who write to the Times. But if Russia is going to be a force in the outside world, it will not be the result of Mr Zinovieff’s money. Russia will never matter seriously to the rest of us, unless it be as a moral force. So, now the deeds are done and there is no going back, I should like to give Russia her chance ; to help and not to hinder. For how much rather, even after allowing for everything, if I were a Russian, would I contribute my quota of activity to Soviet Russia than to Tsarist Russia! I could not subscribe to the new official faith any more than to the old. I should detest the actions of the new tyrants not less than those of the old. But I should feel that my eyes were turned towards, and no longer away from, the possibilities of things ; that out of the cruelty
1-13-short-view-russia	doc_13_56_1	and stupidity of Old Russia nothing could ever emerge, but that beneath the cruelty and stupidity of New Russia some speck of the ideal may lie hid.

As she walked along a passage, a door suddenly burst open, as though forced by the hubbub behind it, and King Charles came out, tucking his arm under the quivering one of a tall, handsome young man, whose face was flushed with excitement, and whose eye yet glowed as he swore to the King he had meant him no disrespect. “Wilmot, Wilmot!” the King said, laughing, but serious behind his smile, “‘by rights this hand I hold ought to be hacked off; but then hell would be cheated of just so much of the fuel that is due to it.” With that he spun him round, and sent him along the corridor away from her; and coming towards her himself, caught her up, and carried her on his shoulder to where my father was laughing with my mother in an ante-room.

Yet, lately, on the eve of a fight with Lord Mulerave, he sent him a letter to say he was sick, and would not meet him.

I have heard him when he was plying the bottle with the rest, all at once quote some lines of Homer — as he told me afterwards they were — and seem to concern himself with ancient heroes and gods, with Telemathus and Pallas, rather than with the company about him. He had powerful parts, and I, who have but gathered my philosophy in the wide world, thinking it more full of flowers than the garden of Epicurus, could never reach his highest thoughts. Indeed, his mind brooked questioning as little as his mood. If he professed atheism — which I detest as much as does your royal father — it was because he would not be governed as much as because he was eager to take his thoughts to the uttermost verge: but he dared also return.

You are wise, sir, beyond your years: but as for our plat-banded friend, you are not yet cool enough in blood to see the merit of a man of a kidney foreign to your own. I would trudge a score of miles on the dirtiest night to see John Wilmot once again, and not a yard at noonday to see our Burnet, for he cares for poetry as a fanatic does for prelaty, only to despise it. But he looks you in the face, and if you struck him would strike you back, and in his own way he has wit. He could never choose between two rights, but he knows what is downright foolish.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_36_0	FitzJames. He wept for Russell.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_37_0	Etheredge. His tears were for his friend, his judgment did not gloze his faults. You think it odd in me, Mr FitzJames, to speak thus, for a badger to applaud a basset. But, in truth, my thoughts were full of Rochester, and my mind often returning to inquire why it was for Burnet that he sent in his last sickness, I have come to see the merits of the priest. For Rochester would seek no porridge faith: it was always meat he hankered after, and there was bone in Burnet to give it him. Wilmot would like his religion to be like his wine, plentiful and strong: he would prefer the vials of wrath to the bosom of Abraham, howsoever warm and downy. He might have been a martyr; he could never have been a saint.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_38_0	FitzJames. The poet Flatman, I remember, in a pastoral on his death, prayed us “Live not like Strephon, but
2-2-rochester	doc_14_39_0	like Strephon die.”

2-2-rochester	doc_14_41_0	It has been hinted by the pious, Mr FitzJames, that my Lords Rochester and Dorset, Sir Charles Sidley and myself, lived only for the flesh — and if even now I have not altogether achieved a perfect chastity I must blame the goodness of my constitution — but indeed, as you will in time regretfully discover, the flesh is but food for children. My religion — which I ponder in my heart, and prefer to keep there rather than in my tongue, unlike some who make about it as much clack as the water passing through the paper mills of old London Bridge — tells me that to enjoy our faculties is no sin. But, alas! we soon weary of the enjoyment, and seek the flesh only to escape from ourselves. A single amour becomes as dull as a single plot in a play, and there is more pleasure in seeing a woman break her fan in anger than her vows in joy. For love is but the reflection of our own youth, in a pond spangled with lilies, and the image is shattered when we grasp at a bloom, or even by our breath alone as we approach our faces to see the image closer.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_42_0	If Wilmot’s death was premature, his life was always in advance of his years, and in his thirty-three his thoughts held the compass of a larger life. When after leaving Oxford at fourteen he went abroad in the company of a tutor, he was already too much a man to be ruled. If the tutor encouraged his love of the Muses, he also gave him his taste for opposition, for he thwarted his pranks, and by his severity taught him boldness and cunning. But of cunning he soon tired; an intrigue to him became as insipid as a dismal dinner in a country house, where the » gayest noise in the vast rooms within is the shuffling of the butler’s steps, and nothing is heard without but the melancholy cawing of the rooks. For it came to seem as though for him where fear was absent the dishes lacked salkt. When he dwelt at Blackfriars, in the guise of a German Nostradamus, he found the aldermen’s wives too easy to be worth his taking: and at eighteen he ravished Mrs Malet from her coach as it was passing Charing Cross, because she resisted his flame. But she married him two years later.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_43_0	FitzJames. The spicing of that dish must have seemed a trifle too high, for I remember hearing that my uncle Charles was most incensed by this, and sent him to the Tower.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_44_0	Etheredge. Not for the only time, but never for many days together. Who could be angry with Wilmot for long? Indeed he feared nothing, not the Dutch, nor the devil, nor even the King, for his wicked rhymes scathed even royalty. He climbed to the top of daring, and I have sometimes thought that in his pagan vows, his argued worship of Bacchus or the sun, he only sought for something against which to pit himself: and I have even wondered whether in his repentance he did not seek for God only that sin might have a savour.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_45_0	FitzJames. Sir George, you frighten me! Look! I cross myself. But indeed I have heard that he once took one of Mr Quarles’ religious poems, and writing the word “love” wherever the name of God occurred, sent it to his mistress to declare his ardour. What infamy!

2-2-rochester	doc_14_48_0	Etheredge. Pardon me! I fear I have talked too much, and have been wanting in civility to engross more than my share of speech. My long abstinence has made me over-greedy, for I am weary of entertaining myself with solitude and silence. I abstain.

2-2-rochester	doc_14_51_0	Your mother, Mr FitzJames, would remember the strange tales of Miss Hobart that used to be bandied about the court. She was tall, vivacious, and her eye, though hard, had fire: but we manner was masculine, and from her behaviour to the beau sexe it was thought by some that she had more fitly worn the pantaloon than the farthingale, In any case, the Mother of the Maids, of the Duchess of York’s, I mean, feared her attentions to her niece, whom she put under the protection of Rochester.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_52_0	FitzJames. As though a wolf in wolf’s clothing were less harmful than one in a fleece! Was the wench comely?

Comely enough, though then she was barely even in her salad years, and she became the most moving of creatures, with the most swimming figure, the best for But our business is not with Sarah, let us call her here. It is with Miss Temple, another of the Duchess’ maids of honour.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_54_0	FitzJames. The one who is now Lady Littleton?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_55_0	Etheredge. With an ever-growing brood of childten. Then she was fetching, with soft brown hair, a perfect figure, lingering eyes, a skin like creamy satin, and a welcoming smile that showed even teeth as white as lilies of the valley. But she was vain, gullible, at once confiding and suspicious, prudish and artfully coy, complacent and emptyheaded. But in love, so long as the eyes sparkle and the cheek receives a thousand sweeter graces, we do not always tarry to ask what lies behind; and Wilmot and Miss Hobart became rivals in the same race.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_56_0	FitzJames. But did Miss Temple rejoice at so strange a commerce?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_57_0	Etheredge. Poor innocent! she never saw behind the fleece. Miss Hobart’s tall-boy of jams and comfits was the lure she stooped to, and neglecting the barbadoes, orange waters, and other chafers of the blood the cupboard entertained, crammed her little mouth as full of sweetmeats as Gargantua his belly with pork.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_58_0	FitzJames. But did not the Duchess or my father take any heed?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_59_0	Etheredge. Your father, if I may say so at this distant date, was the too active in attentions to /a belle Fennings, your uncle Churchill’s wife’s sister, to bestir himself in domestic policy; especially as his vows were, to say truth, ill received: for the Jennings would tumble his unopened diMets-doux out of her sleeve in the very drawingroom, like an apple-tree showering blossoms. And Her Highness, with a steadiness that did honour to her virtue, though no credit to her knowledge, was constant in regarding the whispers about Miss Hobart as old wives’ tales and malicious libels. She not only brought her closer to herself, but helped the devil by giving Mistress Temple into her charge, to screen her from Rochester and Sidney, a mighty pretty youth, a task from which Hobart was as much averse as a hungry hobnol from plum pottage.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_60_0	One day in the summer of ’64 or ’65, in any case before I was as free of the court as I afterwards grew to be, so I can only speak from hearsay, Temple came back from a ride as hot as newbaked dumpling, and asked leave to shift in Hobart’s chamber, where she could, as she cooled, bury her pretty teeth in the candies. You may be sure Hobart gave no refusal, and highly commending Temple for her cleanly manners—so different, she protested, from those of Jennings, who only washed what could be seen, and that for fashion’s sake — made haste to unlace her with her own hands while her Hebe was abroad. When Temple stood up only in the scant livery of her shift, she invited her to come to a couch in the bathing-room within, where, she said, they could speak at their case, without fear of disturbance from fops or farce-fools.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_61_0	FitzJames. Was my Lord Rochester in Miss Temple’s graces, or did she, rather, harbour a tendre for Sidney?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_62_0	Etheredge. Where Rochester bent his mind, a dozen Sidneys might bend their waists in the most courtly bows in vain. The rogue, seeing Temple mounted on her small acquirements, swore he was dazzled by her brain rather than by her beauties, and would bring his verses to her conquering eyes as though they were the judging ones of Apollo. He would say that had Heaven fashioned him of the stuff that falls victim to outward charms, he would have been lost indeed: but that as, by God’s grace, it was only by his soul he could be snared, he was happy to be able to indulge with her in the sweetest converse under the sun without the smallest danger. With such hearty, sincere prologues
2-2-rochester	doc_14_63_0	FitzJames. Sincere, Sir George?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_64_0	Etheredge. In faith, I believe he was sincere, in one sense, for without he could make an amour serious, it was none at all to him. Thus his frank air of honesty ruined many a reputation, and this he cared for more than to gain a kindness. After such prologues, I say, asking humbly for approval, swearing that all that might rival Miss Temple’s talents was kneeling there before her in apology, he would present her with his last wrought satire or song. Such notions turned her pretty, vacant head: but as yet she gave him merely commendation, little thinking he sought only for kisses. But let us return to the bathing-room, which you will find, Mr FitzJames, not lacking in matter for diversion.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_65_0	For little Sarah had wheedled permission from Hobart’s chamber-wench to wash herself there on occasion, and on this very day was so occupied. Or, rather, having filled a bath with cold Thames water, was about to proceed to the business, when she heard Hobart and ‘Temple coming in upon her. She could only in the nick of time draw the curtains that shrouded the baths and slip into the water, when the ladies came in and settled down to the prettiest itte-d-téte in the world. And Hobart had a plaguy long sermon to preach, on the wicked perfidy of men, on their lust to prey on weakly innocence, and on all the horror and faithlessness of wedlock. She told how my Lord Oxford had cheated Mrs Marshall with a sham Levite and a suborned witness, and drew the conclusion that court marriages were a snare. How much better to keep one’s bosom aloof from the springes of men! Poor Temple, who smelt no rat in Hobart’s plaints, so could not smoke the game, lent her ears with as much zeal and alacrity as a dean does to the offer of a mitre: and so did little Sarah, who shivered with the cold water up to her neck, till she was as blue as the ribbon of the Garter.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_66_0	“Look,” said Hobart, “at your suitors. Sidney casts moonlike eyes upon you: Rochester is alert to please, and even Littleton’s ponderous sighs erow lighter for your glances. But ‘Sidney is penniless, and would never do for you, apart from things about him you are too young for me to tell you. As for Rochester, if he is the man of most wit in all England, he jg also the man of least honour. He jg dangerous, but only for our sex, for if we fly from his embraces we are caught by his libels. He is as cunning as an Oliver-man, worming himself into our breasts with his flatteries, for he follows our tastes and desires, likes what we like, and without saying a syllable of what he thinks, makes you believe every word he utters.”
2-2-rochester	doc_14_67_0	FitzJames. It was not for nothing, then, he read Ovid and Juvenal.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_68_0	Etheredge. I compliment you, Mr FitzJames, upon your learning, and Hobart might have found you as dangerous. “There,” she went on to say into Temple’s yawning ear, “I'll wager that from the things he has said to you, you believe him the sincerest and best man in the world; but when he has conquered the loveliest creature about the court, he will not know how to treat you otherwise than he does the wretches all the orange-women in the town are under commission to supply him with. Moreover, he is so eaten up with malice, that already he has paid you court only the more easily to lampoon you. You have reason to look astonished, you may well doubt,me, but see here!”” With that she pulled from her corset a copy of scurrilous papers Wilmot had written upon Miss Price, who had angered him, accusing her of bodily deformities which Hobart made haste to assure her friend she was by no means guilty of, and would have verified with her own eye had she not feared to startle her modesty. Poor Temple, who up till now had swallowed it all down as greedily as she did the raspberry jam in the cupboard, was almost in tears with shame and mortification, and left as soon as she could, while her protector toasted herself in barbadoes on the pretty progress she had made.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_69_0	Sarah, her teeth chattering like the watchman’s rattle, also ran off as soon as might be to warm herself in arms that were used to hold her more closely than is_required from those of protectors, and Wilmot was soon made free of the whole tale, without a detail being lost or smudged in the telling.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_70_0	FitzJames. ‘The wolf had already,
2-2-rochester	doc_14_71_0	then, devoured that lamb?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_72_0	Etheredge. I have not heard that the lamb ever repined at it: she even came to have a taste for such sacrifices, and grew to an arrant jilt. Wilmot wasted a thousand hells and furies, and would willingly have passed his sword through the man-woman. He swore revenge, and commending Sarah, bade her ever and anon bring her what private news she could discover.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_73_0	Such a change that day came over poor Temple as made the whole court wonder at her, and think her sickening for the veil. She showed gloomy and morose, and when a compliment was paid her, sharpened her eyes to daggers. She thought every gallant kept in his pocket those libellous verses of Wilmot, and had in his mind that some vile curiosity was hid by her corsage or farthingale. Her fevered fancy made her suppose each compliment concealed a sneer. When Wilmot came in that evening she flushed scarlet, then went white as her colberteen scarf, tottered towards him, checked, pulled her gloves up to the elbow, opened and closed her fan, and when he came to salute her, twisted around and offered him her back. Wilmot only smiled, and walking about her to make her manner the more remarkable, said: “Madam, it passes thought how you can thus shine after so fatiguing a day. To bear a three hours’ ride, and then to undergo Miss Hobart without an eyelid fluttering for weariness, is indeed a proof of spirit.” Temple’s eyes blazed like exploding grenades, and Hobart’s pinching her arm made them glow so hot that a deluge of reproaches seemed like to follow. But Wilmot, without stopping to thank Hobart for the turn she had done him, withdrew to await, while Temple vowed to herself never again to speak with so false a villain.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_74_0	A few days later, Sarah came post to Wilmot with a story of a merry frisk that Temple, against Hobart’s counsels, was determined to play at, which was that the two fillys should swap dresses and parade the Mallin vizards. Wilmot sent for Killigrew — whom he had not yet slapped — and asked for his help to revenge himself. So that evening there was a meeting in the Mall, and Wilmot, pretending to mistake Hobart for Temple, drew her off, while Killigrew, walking with the lively innocent, rated her soundly under the name of Hobart. He told her that all was known of their conversation, that Littleton had sworn to repay her, that the Duchess was incensed at some confidences she had made public, and that Wilmot, the most honnéte homme in the world, would never dream of casting eyes at Miss Temple unless he meant sober marriage. What was more to the purpose, he made so plain to Temple what it was Hobart designed to her, that the poor girl was filled with dreadful confusion, and made off to St James? in very near a swoon. There she tore oft Hobart’s dress as fast as her trembling fingers would let her, and in fear of some abhorred contamination, at once sent the infected garment back to its owner by her maid. Hobart, bewildered by Temple’s manner since their parade, kept the chamber-wench, and _ herself hurried to her charge’s room, where, thinking to surprise her by some delicate
2-2-rochester	doc_14_74_1	token of friendship, she clasped her from behind and saluted her on the lips. Temple, im horror at finding herself caught in the arms that in all the world she now most loathed, and with what she believed a satyr’s eyes leering at her, set to screaming, and alarmed all the household. ‘The first to arrive were Sarah and the Mother of the Maids, who seeing Temple ex déshabillé struggling in the embraces of Hobart, eager only to wrest some explanation from a mouth obstinately mute except for screaming, believed all she had ever been told, and poured such a cascade of vituperation over Hobart as is rarely heard outside Billingsgate.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_75_0	In two days the story was in every salon and chocolate house, and all the gallants tumbled over one another to tell Miss Temple that she had no need to fear that the raillery intended to Price were meant for, or believed of, the most beautifully formed of all the maids of honour; so that in her contrition she resolved to do all in her power to make amends to Rochester. But, alas! he was unable to profit by her softened humour, for at that time he once more incurred the displeasure of our royal master, and was banished to the deserts of Oxfordshire.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_76_0	FitzJames. The Hobart, too, I suppose, was banished?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_77_0	Etheredge. By no means, for Her Highness was still incredulous, and did all she could to cleanse her reputation, though without avail. On the contrary, the Mother of the Maids was dismissed for making an idle tumult and acting the garrulous fishwife. Thus Rochester did not go to Woodstock alone, for she companioned him, as did also, I need hardly add, Miss Sarah.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_78_0	FitzJames. It is an odd matter, Sir George, that Rochester’s most exquisite poems — for I have read them — sing praise of constancy, and vaunt the undying singleness of his flame.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_79_0	Ernerece. Few of us, Mr FitzJames, have the gift to be constant to ourselves, and I, who have often looked into myself as I idly rolled about the town, have failed to find what I would. Only the present moment is our own; the past has slipped from our grasp, while the future is not yet, and we cannot claim it - the thought is Wilmot’s—and though we may wish our vows were eternal, we have no more right to gird at our fortune if we change, than others have to fleer at our faith.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_80_0	FitzJames. Is not that, Sir George, too easy an excuse for disloyalty? Must men always be reeds shaken in the wilderness of their feelings?
2-2-rochester	doc_14_81_0	Etheredge. Unfaithful Rochester may have been, disloyal never. If he betrayed his wife, he would not suffer her to be insulted, and in his care for his mother he deserved the love she gave him.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_82_0	FitzJames. Even the wolf sometimes remembers his dam.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_83_0	Etheredge. But Wilmot was no wolf, though you have three times called him such. Where trust was given him he gave trust: when he offered loyalty, he was pained at its refusal or betrayal. When the Duchess of ——, but that name I will cloak, without foundation suspected his integrity (and in truth he had given her the best that was in him), such rebellion was raised in his heart against her that he never forgave. If he was proud, it was with the pride of the magnanimous that can well forget a blow but cannot pass over a slur. It was easy to open his heart: despite closed it for ever, for the deepest wounds produce the hardest cicatrice.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_84_0	FitzJames. He must indeed have been various.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_85_0	Etheredge. Wilmot had every gift, and what was constant in him was a craving for discovery. Often on some frolic, when as a mountebank or merchant, or as companion to the King, he seemed borne on the wings of enjoyment, his face would cloud over: and onceata debauch, when all his wit, his spirit, his abundant grace were more intoxicating than the wine, and he seemed himself to be Pan or the young Bacchus, he clasped my arm till the fingers wounded me, and whispered passionately into my ear: “Tt isn’t that: it isn’t there.”
2-2-rochester	doc_14_86_0	FitzJames. Unhappy soul to be foiled of even the mean profit of pleasure!
2-2-rochester	doc_14_87_0	Etheredge, Sometimes, indeed, he complained to us that all life was like the fruit growing by the Dead Sea, which seems so fair a melon when taken in the hand, but when carried to the mouth is more bitter than the Jesuits’ powder.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_88_0	FitzJamrs. There is a fierce intensity in his satire I have found in no other.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_89_0	Etheredge. Mr Marvell rightly said he had the true vein of it, and he himself was no mean inditer of iambics: but, indeed, Rochester never rose to the height of my friend Mr Dryden, though he informs me his MacFlecknoe does no good. But even in his lighter verse he was stubborn to reach a conclusion, a virtue most of us lack. His thought does not falter, so his stanzas are not weak about the loins like Sir Charles Sidley’s. My Lord Dorset is the best-natured man — many a frolic I have had with him after the draggle-tailed nymphs can vouch for it — and for that very reason has not the worst-natured muse: but when Rochester wrote, a cold fury directed him; and, always too passionately dissatisfied, he came even to the strife of love coldly though furiously. For five years without a stop he warmed his thought with wine, but in truth there was little difference between Wilmot drunk and Wilmot sober, for lodged within him there was an icicle no fumes could thaw, a demon no extravagance could beguile. Sweetness in verse he learned from Cowley, correctness from Boileau, but his thought he drew from the founts of Bandusia, and his fire was of his own most private fuel.
2-2-rochester	doc_14_90_0	But I see, Mr FitzJames, your head nods, and I weary you with my old beaux’s chatter. It has been for me so happy a relief from sixpenny ombre with martial ladies prouder of their quarterings than of their colour, and who have never flirted a fan. Allow me to fill your glass!’ No?

2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_3_0	Synopsis — National and international use of languages. — “ Fixed English ” arranged on the “label system,” that is, on a system of logically generalised preconceptions, as opposed to “English proper,” which is more a language of “ conceits ”’ or pictorial images. — English a lingua franca of later development than most other European languages. — Advantages of this development: grammatic flexibility and copiousness of vocabulary. — Drawbacks: the inconsistency of English spelling (but there are certain compensations even here) and a temptation to slovenliness of expression and thought. — The differentiation of words in English — Examples of the development of words by associative use. — The fluidity of English in the coining, borrowing, and interchange of words still maintained : the tacit consent of one’s fellows as the only test of correctness. — The occasional falsification of thought that a “ logical ” language causes. - Attempted reformations of English helpful but never final; the expanding process continues in spite of authority. — The associative method analogous to sympathetic magic, the label system to rationalism. — The whimsical element in English. — Concentration of many senses in a single conceit. — Recent grammatic and syntactic novelties—Why there is no standard English prose, but only prose of a certain style and period. — The limitations of an international language.

2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_5_0	The original occasion of this paper — a course of public lectures at the Egyptian University at Cairo — is plainly recalled by the home-thoughts-from-abroad sentiment that pervades it. The audience was largely Oriental, but contained many energetic Francophiles whose assumptions about the English language were known to be both uncritical and unflattering. This atmosphere prompted a review of those classroom commonplaces on the peculiar nature of English, which, mostly in the form of comparisons with French and German, have for years been copied from one blackboard to another without due inquiry into their truth. It is usually accepted, for example, that French is a more exact, more philosophic language than English, but that English is an easier language to learn than French: both of these views can be questioned, except in a very limited sense. And that ‘French is the language for love but English for science: but, on the other hand, French is the prosaic, English the poetic language ”’ is a paradox in need of very careful defence. At the same time such unfriendly charges occur as “English is chaotic and utterly unsuited for clear thought,” and have to be met by showing that this chaos is only the apparent disorder of a workshop in which a great deal of repair and other work is in progress: the benches are crowded, the corners piled with lumber, but the old hand knows just where to find any spare part or accessory needed, or at any rate can lay

2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_6_0	In considering any language, a careful distinction must be made and kept between its popular native form and the form to which it is adapted for official and educative routine and for international trade in goods and ideas, between its unrestrained idiomatic use and a controlled, sterilised, cut-anddried form which has been lightened as far as possible of all the complexities, subtleties, and distortions which might confuse a fool or a foreigner. A few languages only, of which French and Italian as spoken by the educated classes are the readiest examples, pass almost unchanged into international currency and show no obvious cleavage between their official and literary phrasing. English is not one of these. Foreigners are often unaware that the English which they have studied in schools or privately with the help of grammars and dictionaries — let us call it “‘fixed English” — though at first sight similar, is a very different language from the more fluid form — let us call it English proper — which they meet in imaginative literature, and in which the more English of the English make jokes, poems, and sometimes love. It is a frequent cause of exasperation, for where the Englishman claims intricacy, concord, and beauty, the foreigner, who is not admitted to the secret, finds only muddle, contradiction, and madness.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_7_0	French, Italian, and to a lesser extent Modern German, are what are known as logical languages: they are reasonable codifications of as much of human experience as can be translated into speech. ‘They give each separate object, rocess, or quality a permanent label duly docketed, and ever afterwards recognise this object, process, or quality by its label rather than by itself; forbidding it to appear unless with the label correctly attached. These languages are therefore also the rhetorical languages, rhetoric being the poetry of labels and not the poetry of the things themselves. English proper has always been very much a language of “conceits’; that is, except for the purely grammatic parts of speech, which are in general colourless enough, the vocabulary is not fully dissociated from the imagery from which it developed: words still tend to be pictorial and not typographic. ‘The word “conceit” originally meant an image or pictorial idea contained in a word or juxtaposition of words, but the neo-Classical influence In criticism eventually gave it the sense of “unnecessary and exhibitory ornament” and so “vanity”; at best now, the same critical influence surviving, it will mean “imaginative concepts beautifying but not essential to logical thought on the label system.” Fortunately in English one is permitted to restore a word to its original sense, if notice is given; and so resisting the alien critical standards since imposed, let us firmly agree that English proper is a language not of labels but rather of “conceits”’ or “pictorial images.”
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_8_0	Matthew Arnold, who as a critic did not do sufficient justice to the peculiarly English habit of thought, points out in his essay on the “Influence of Literary Academies” that: “The power of French Literature is in its prosewriters, the power of English Literature in its poets. While the fame of many celebrated poets of France depends on the qualities of intelligence they exhibit, qualities which are the distinctive support of prose, many of the celebrated prose-writers of England depend wholly for their fame on the imaginative qualities they exhibit, which are the distinctive support of Poetry.” The truth is, that for French prose-writers and many celebrated French verse-writers the conceits of the words they use are dulled and show no rebellious tendency to form illicit assemblies that might affect the argument. For English writers of prose or verse, so soon as a gust of natural feeling snatches away the typographical disguise in which their words are dressed, the conceits appear in all freedom: at first they enliven and enforce the argument, but after a while, if the author is not wary, they desert it and begin a digressive dance of their own. It is a commonplace that the English have no feeling for purity of literary form in the Classical sense: it is their strength and weakness that native imaginative exuberance breaks down all literary restraint. Serious critical writing is frequently punctuated — as this very paper may prove to be — by mild jokes and sometimes effective, sometimes
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_8_1	strained analogy; the broadest farce may develop sudden periods of poetic beauty, and so also may the most formal theology; philosophy in England often hesitates between satire, practical psychology, ejaculatory descriptive passages, and philosophy proper. Tragi-comedy is the clearest instance of this peculiarity in English literature: it is a form almost unknown on the Continent: at its worst it is an absurd episodic carnival, but at its best, where a constructive intelligence is present to reconcile the apparently incompatible elements, a greater integrity and clarity results than is possible within the limitations of pure Classical form. Tragi-comedy is the hit-or-miss dramatic form, and English proper is the hit-or-miss language.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_9_0	Fixed English, which dates perhaps from Dr Johnson’s Dictionary, completed in 1755, fulfils the need of a safer, less ambitious language arranged on the Same system and dedicated to the same uses as French; it isa language of agreed Preconceptions. Fixed English makes possible a French-English, English-French, or a German-English, EnglishGerman dictionary. Each foreign label can find its English fellow. For example, “glory” is matched with “la gloire,” and “méatelot”? with “sailor.” Fixed English compares very well with other languages: but is often more mechanically, and therefore more properly employed by foreigners than by Englishmen, who are always inclined to slip back into English proper. Fixed English is an easy language to learn, like colloquial Arabic: but of English proper, as of Arabic proper, no wise man will ever claim final mastery: there is no discovered end to either language.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_10_0	English, whether fixed or free, has certain unusual advantages in structure. In the first place it is almost uninflected and has no genders. The Romance languages and German—but let us treat more particularly of French, because the French are nearer the English in geography, and farther removed in mental habit than any other European nation: France is historically the sweet enemy of England — these languages, then, though in other respects more logical, have not had occasion to simplify themselves similarly, have clung without question to their genders and inflections.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_11_0	Now in any logical sense there is no justification for genders. They are a survival from a mythological time when the supposed sex of any object — trees, diseases, cooking implements — had to be considered for the sake of religious convention or taboo. The religious sense disappeared in prehistoric times: the genders remain as a decoration or frill without which the languages that keep them would feel undressed. Even new words have to decide, so soon as coined, on their hypothetical sex, concretes and abstractions alike. ‘This sense of lingual modesty must of course be reckoned with: the Romance languages and German have what amounts to an aesthetic objection to an English sentence like: “The boy, the man, and the woman had the same feelings.” They prefer the decorative variety of “Le garcon, l’homme, et la femme avaient les mémes sentiments.” But when a language is used for international exchange the practical disadvantages of gender are generally admitted to outweigh its decorative qualities. Gender is illogical, in being partly used to express actual sex, e.g. Le garçon, la femme, and partly used without thought of sex, e.g. la masculinité, le feminisme, le festin, la féte, so that if one does wish to give sex-characteristics to concrete objects or abstractions, as, for example, masculinity to “sword” and “pen” and femininity to “Parliament,” the fixed gender is an actual hindrance to any such renewal of mythology. An inflected tense, also, has a beauty from which these languages rightly refuse to be
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_11_1	"parted. But for merely practical uses an inflected tense such as je serai, tu seras, il sera, nous S€rons, vous serez, ils seront seems unnecessary to an Englishman, content with I will be, you will be, he will be, we will be, they will be, particularly since the French have dropped noun and adjective inflections almost as completely as English. The only possible variation in English of the future tense is the alternation of “‘shall” and “will"" as auxiliaries: but this is an alternation that shows varying attitudes to the future (intention, compulsion, and direction), it is not merely decorative, English is a language of later development than other European languages: it is more copious and less inflected. The gradual tendency of language since the beginning of modern civilisation has been continuously towards the simplification of grammar. ‘The most ancient languages of which we have record, such as Sanscrit and Eskimo, are not, as one would expect, rude in structure, but on the contrary so elaborate in tense, case, mood, and gender that to learn the elements of any such will take as long a time as to become fluent in any four unrelated civilised languages. The present tendency to simplify grammar is due to the enormous number of new jdeas, objects, and aspects of things which the speeding-up of civilisation brings. Breadth of vocabulary is given in exchange for depth of grammar: so all recent inventors of new languages, such as Ido, Volapuk, and Esperanto, have agreed in reducing"
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_11_2	grammar to its bare bones. English began after the Norman Conquest as a lingua franca between the French-speaking invaders, who assumed the entire government and religious control of the country, and the mixed Anglo-Saxon-Danish population on whom they depended for labour and supplies. It was natural for the minority to make the language of the majority the base of the lingua franca rather than the other way about: and the dignity of French-speaking could be thus maintained. French was the language of the court and the law for a century or two after English had established itself for all ordinary purposes and become the accepted literary language, but the eventual disappearance of French was never in doubt once the grammar of Saxon, already weakened by the Danish invasions, was further simplified by the requirements of the French-speaking invaders. The lingua franca was at first deficient in words to fit the new methods of trade and government, and these had to be supplied from the French which was culturally in advance of Anglo-Saxon because of its closer connection with Rome, the source of all contemporary culture. So passing the stage of Broken Saxon, English developed a free and easy grammar and syntax, a modification of Anglo-Saxon, but with French turns wherever a legal or literary subtlety was needed: the vocabulary, remaining Anglo-Saxon in foundation, was enormously enriched with Norman-French and Latin words of advanced cultural history. So it is that while there are at least twice as many Romance words in
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_11_3	English as native ones, these native words are used five times as often as the Romance words. One of the happiest features of this development of English was that the parts of speech ceased to be strictly used: adjectives were made to do service for nouns, and nouns were turned into verbs, until it could be said that all parts of speech in English can be interchanged. We can use a pronoun for a noun: “That not impossible she.” Or a conjunction for a verb, or for a noun: “But me no buts.” Or a verb for noun: “To go on strike.” Or a noun for a verb: ‘Foot it neatly on the green.” In the sentence “A briar pipe has no equal,” “‘briar,” a noun, does duty for an adjective; “equal,” an adjective, does duty for a noun. This interchange is a great help to meaning where the adjective formed in the usual way from a noun, or the verb formed from the noun, has divagated slightly from its original sense. For instance, if one wished to write of the inflections of a verb and did not wish to write “‘verbal inflections” because “verbal” means “of a word” rather than “‘of a verb,” one would be free to speak of “verb-inflections,” using a noun for an adjective.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_12_0	Further gains to English at this early period were the wide choice of prefixes and suffixes which the pooling of the wealth of both languages gave, the use of auxiliary words to help out the verbtenses, and new freedoms won by prepositions. ‘There is a greater richness of prepositions in English than in most other civilised languages: for instance, in French de has to bear the whole burden of the English prepositions “of? “From,” “out,” and à of “at” “to,” “til,’ and German has no separation between “of” and “from”; “into” and “out of” are double prepositions with no equivalent in either French or German. But it is not merely the greater choice of prepositions that gives English a greater subtlety in their use. For example, James Clarence Mangan, in his humorous essay, “My Bugle and how I blow it,” published in the early 1830’s, makes a good point about one use of the preposition “in.” He writes:—
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_13_0	I am the Man in the Cloak. In other words, I am by no manner of means the Man of the Cloak or the Man under the Cloak. The Germans call me ‘‘Der Mensch mit dem Mantel,” the Man with the Cloak. This is a deplorable error in the nomenclature of that otherwise intelligent people: because my cloak is not part and parcel of myself. “The cloak is outside and the man is inside, but. each is a distinct entity. I admit you may say, ‘‘ The Man with the Greasy Countenance,” thus also Slawken-Bergius (vide Tristram Shandy) calls his hero ‘‘ The Stranger with the Nose,” for . . . however long . . . the nose was an integral part of the individual. With me the case is a horse of another colour. I do not put my cloak on and off, I grant, but I can do so when I please: and therefore it is obvious to the meanest capacity that I am the Man in the Cloak and no mistake,
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_14_0	Mangan’s objection to the German idiom could have been strengthened by an opposite objection to the French “L’homme á la redingote,” where the greater emphasis is laid on the cloak than on the man: Mangan, as he says, is not “the Man of the Cloak??; yet “T’homme dans la redingote” is no more French than “Der Mensch in dem Mantel” is German.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_15_0	It is of this flexibility of English that Sir Philip Sidney writes in his Apologie for Poetry.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_16_0	English giveth us great occasion to the right use of matter and manner, being indeed capable of any excellent exercising of it. I know some will say that it is a mingled language. And why not so much the better, taking the best of both the other? Another will say it wanteth Grammar. Nay, truly it hath that praise, that it wanteth not Grammar, for Grammar it might have, but it ‘needs it not; being so easy of itself ang so void of those cumbersome differences of Cases, Genders, Moods, and Tenses, which I think was a piece of the Tower of Babylon’s curse, that a man should be put to school to learn his mother tongue. But for the utter. ing sweetly and properly the conceits of the mind, which is the end of speech, that it hath it equally with any other tongue in the world: and is particularly happy in compositions of two or three words together, near the Greek, far beyond the Latin: which is one of the greatest beauties can be in a language.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_17_0	The admirable growth of English as a common language of conqueror and conquered had one great disadvantage: the slowness with which it arrived at a common convention for the pronunciation and spelling of words. Neither the French nor the Anglo-Saxons could form their mouths properly for the management of the others’ language, particularly of the vowels, yet the French scribes had to write Saxon words in their legal records, and the Saxon scribes in submitting accounts in writing had to adopt a convention of spelling which their masters would understand. English spelling therefore hardened before a common vowel-pronunciation had been arrived at: or it would be truer to say that a local convention hardened in each district according to the dialect spoken. East Midland was the English dialect that finally triumphed, but words were introduced from other dialects where a slightly different spelling had been in vogue; and when at last a general convention of spelling and pronunciation was reached, it was, and remains, a tissue of inconsistencies: the one serious handicap to English as an official or international language.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_18_0	The termination -ough, for instance, occurs in words as differently sounded as “rough,” ‘“‘bough,” “cough,” “thorough,” “though,” “through,” and “‘hiccough”: the gh representing what was once an Anglo-Saxon guttural which corresponds with the Greek x. This guttural the Norman-French either could not or would not pronounce: either they made an f sound of it or they sounded the vowel and left out the consonant altogether. It is probable that this habit became fashionable among those natives who wished to pass as members of the ruling caste, and except in the North, where it lasted much later and still survives in many dialect words, the gh passed out of the spoken language, and remains in the written merely as an historic note.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_19_0	To the different pronunciation of vowels in different parts of the country, these -ough words are sufficient witnesses; and to the inconsistency of the spelling convention, the “ch” in “church,” “Christian,” “chivalry,” and “pibroch.” ‘The trouble is that in English there are only twenty-three letters (three others—x, k, and q—being redundant) to express forty-three sounds: and this was always too much for the scribes. They tried various methods, such as the doubling of the ‘consonant to show that the vowel which comes before is short, e.g. batter, and the final ¢ after a consonant to show that the vowel is long, e.g. bone. But none of these methods could be used consistently while the pronunciation was still so various; and the scribes did as well as could be expected short of making a new alphabet.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_20_0	The spelling of a word is often, however, valuable in suggesting the date and origin of its appearance in the language. The case of Romance words in “-on”?’ is typical. “Mutton” is an early borrowing, and therefore kept its original terminal spelling. Three centuries or so later, when the French on sound had been Englished as ‘-on,” new -on words imported, such as balon, marron, musqueton, salon, were spelt “balloon,” “marroon,” “musquetoon,” “saloon.” This “oo,” which also represented the narrow vowel in the word “good,” later got confused with the broader sound as in “food” and “moon.” But “mutton” was still pronounced as before. In more recent times the English have either spelt and pronounced the newly borrowed words
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_21_0	"in -on in the proper French way, if they are educated words, such as soupçon and raison d'étre, or, if they are words capable of popular use, they have Englished them much as they did the words first borrowed. So béton, as in “conductor’s baton,”’ is made to thyme with fatten, and on the barrack-square échelon has come to rhyme with stretch along. On the whole, we are more willing to pronounce and spell foreign words as they are spelt and pronounced in their country of origin. And this new respect for accuracy of pronunciation, which, as has been noticed, does not extend to the masses, has made things rather worse than before. For instance the Irish word “lough,” not long borrowed, has added one more pitfall to the pronunciation of monde in “ough.” Conscientious travellers to Ireland try to compass the sound, but the dictionaries compromise by directing that it shall be pronounced “lok’’; holding that ‘“k” is at any rate a guttural and nearer to the sound than ""f""."
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_22_0	Yet we have sucked certain advantages even from our most indefensible confusions. Where there has been more than one pronunciation of a word, it has very often been split into two words, each devoted to a different sense and usually spelt differently. “Through” and “thorough”’ provide an instance of differentiation both of spelling and pronunciation; “flower” and “flour,” “gest,” and “jest” of differentiation in spelling only. And it sometimes happens that the same word is borrowed more than once from the same language, the first borrowing having already changed in sense. So that the second borrowing becomes a new word in English and, the spelling convention having meanwhile also changed, is easily distinguished from the early borrowing. The word “saloon” was a Tudor borrowing from the French, and, manners and appetites being what they then were, now usually means a “ public eating-room.” Salon, the later borrowing, is a room where wits and men and women of distinction assemble for mutual admiration, and where refreshments are of the lightest. Ina “saloon” one may eat beefsteak-and-onions; in a salon hardly more than a caviare sandwich. ‘ Antick,” with its more modern“antic,” and “antique” enshrine very different views of things antiquated.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_23_0	In accepting English one must accept the inconsistent spelling cheerfully, not only for the practical services it has rendered in the differentiation of meaning, but on its own account, as one learns to accept and even admire the trifling irregularities of a friend’s face. ‘There is to the English eye something distasteful in the idea of phonetic spelling. Attempts to force it upon the language, though supported by all the logic in the world, are unavailing; “because of the ugly look the words have,” the popular reason will be, but there is something stronger behind, even, than an aesthetic objection. Though the use of phonetic spelling can be defended so far as fixed English is concerned, because one merely typographic convention is as good as another in the label system, it is an act of hostility to English proper. If conceits are to take their usual prominent part, the use of a simplified spelling convention stands in the way of their natural emergence. ‘This is clearest in the case of poetry. Poetry in phonetic spelling is not only grotesque in appearance because of its over-use of k’s, z’s, and ay’s: it is actually meaningless, as poetry, because the images get entangled in the net of the spelling, One would have less objection to phonetic or “simplified” spelling if it could be introduced retrospectively in our grandfather’s days: but we do not intend to make sacrifices for the sake of our grandchildren. We will only change our spelling, be sure, when
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_23_1	the Frenchman drops his “le, la, les,”? and agrees to a conjugation like “je serai, il serai, nous serai, vous serai, ils serai,”’ and that will not be to-morrow or next year even. In any case, simplified spelling is useless without an unsimplification of pronunciation. Homophones such as “pier” and “peer”; = Peary “pare,” and “pair” owe a great deal to their various spelling: and if spelling is made phonetic they must decide each on a new pronunciation—“ peer”? may remain “peer,” but ‘pier’ must thyme with “higher.” If “pair” is to remain “pair,” ‘‘pear” must be “‘pee-ar,”’ and “pare”? must be “‘paré.” And ‘the rights of “pyre,” “par,” and pa’ must not be infringed upon. As the regularising of our spelling and pronunciation on a rational basis has never succeeded, partly because there is no cultural centre in England, and never has been, of such commanding influence as, for example, Paris, and partly because an Englishman’s choice of words is as much his own peculiar dialect as his home is his castle—so for the same reasons the permanent dedication of particular words to particular senses, the fixing of English, has never, we have already seen, come to much. There have been occasional literary panjandrums who have undertaken the reformation of the language from a professorial or editorial chair, and have been supported by others of the same missionary spirit. There have even been short periods, usually after a time of civil disturbance, when the cultured classes have had what
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_23_2	may be called “fts of tidiness” and, always under direct continental influence, have begun putting the dictionary into better order. The “Society for Pure English,” recently formed by the Poet Laureate, is getting a great deal of support at this moment, and is the literary equivalent of political Fascism. But at no period have the cultured classes been able to force the habit of tidiness on the nation as a whole. Ben Jonsons, John Drydens, Alexander Popes, Joseph Addisons, Samuel Johnsons, and Matthew Arnolds have only succeeded in civilising the outer crust of the national hastypudding. The imaginative genius of the uneducated and half-educated masses will not be denied expression.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_24_0	Joseph Conrad is the most striking recent example of a writer bent on reforming English. He was a Pole who was completely ignorant of the language until he joined the British merchant service as a young man. When after taking a master’s certificate he eventually settled down as a novelist, he had learned English so correctly and fixed it so carefully in his own mind that native Englishmen are more flattered and astonished at his literary excellence than in love with his writing. The style that was the man” is the publishers’ choice of an epitaph for him. His are library-shelf novels rather than books to put under the pillow. Conrad was always disturbed by the untidiness of English. He complains in one of his essays of a specific word, I believe it is “‘oaken.”” In a Romance language, he points out, the equivalent of “oaken” could only mean one thing; that is, “made of oak-wood.” In English “oaken” can mean both this and many other things, according to the context. An “oaken chaplet” is a chaplet of oak-leaves; an “‘oaken glade” is a glade composed of oaks; and further, the qualities with which oak is popularly credited, such as uprightness, strength, venerability, hardness, its growth from an acorn, its refusal to bend even though it be uprooted; all these qualities are latent in the word ‘‘oaken” and are called up by the requirements of the context in which it occurs. In a poem, “The Moment of Weakness,” by a
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_24_1	contemporary who signs himself John Doyle, the established conceit “hearts of oak” and the improvised conceit “heads of oak” are contrasted. Two sailors, after an exhausting storm in which most of their comrades have perished, decide to sit quietly on the deck of their vessel and recover their strength :—
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_25_0	. . content To set no damage straight, To toss the dice and bait Fish-hooks: to smoke and joke With heads, not hearts of oak,
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_26_0	This is untranslatable into French except by a long periphrasis defeating the necessary quality of conciseness which the context demands. French has, of course, many vivid idioms but far less readily coined, and when coined far more slowly accepted as literary currency than in England: and when accepted more ready to lose their imaginative vigour: so that one can say, “Il vient de sortir” without any “coming” sense in “vient.” For “hearts of oak” the nearest litera equivalent in French is perhaps “le courage inébranlable de nos miatelots.” Now, even supposing that there was a + pa A 99 correct French idiom ‘‘coeurs de chéne, that would establish no tight to the coining of a complementary phrase tétes de chéne.” “‘Tétes de bois” jg perhaps the nearest suitable idiom, but “Heads of oak” is a more particular phrase because “oak-wood” has a particular character distinguishing it from mere “wood.”
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_27_0	French is a language of fixed models: it has none of the workshop untidiness and power of improvisation which characterise English. In French one chooses the finished phrase nearest to one’s purpose, and if there is nothing that can be “‘made to do,” a long time is spent getting the Works to approve a new model. Both methods have their own disadvantages. The English method tends to slovenliness and obscurity in any but the most careful hands, the French to a circumscription of thought, because the codification, however carefully considered in the days of Cardinal Richelieu, is no longer capable of meeting all the demands put upon it by modern thought. It is, for example, impossible in French to give as a section-heading to an article “L’échappé de la contréle,” that is “Escape from Control.” The Preach mind asks “The escape of what from the control of what?” Now in nine cases out of ten that question does demand an answer, and the Englishman may be thinking slovenly in merely saying or writing “Escape from Control.” But in the tenth case “Escape from Control” may be a pure conception, unforeseen in the age of limited logic, which will be spoilt by adding particularities to it. An English psychologist of my acquaintance was once preparing an address to a learned society in Paris. He wrote it in what he hoped was French, but took the precaution of asking a French professor to see that it was correctly phrased. The manuscript was
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_27_1	returned marked in several places: “Pas francais, pas francais, pas francais”: with suggested alterations. But almost in every case the alterations sapped the strength of the argument, and each “pas frangais” could be matched with a “pas vrai.” As in science, so in poetry. A poem of Laura Gottschalk’s begins:
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_28_0	All creatures who wake enjoy the sun, All but one, The sun, because the sun.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_29_0	The French of the last line would have to be “‘Le soleil, parce que c’est le soleil,” and this “c’est le” destroys the absoluteness of the English, in which the sun is not in any way circumscribed with the particular thought of being. These are very fine points and most unusual occasions, and it is probably true to say with Matthew Arnold that, in general, French is a more convenient language to use for the conveyance of intelligence, that is, agreed facts. ‘Thus it comes about that French ‘s the most suitable language for lovemaking: in telling the familiar story of passion, rhetorical French may be a safer vehicle of the emotions than the poetically ambitious English. And the other part of the paradox that “English is a language fittest for science” is also illuminated when we use science in a deeper sense than “encyclopedical arrangement of empiric discovery.” A new scientific idea in a less circumscribed region of knowledge, necessitating new words and even new grammatic constructions, will certainly find English the more complaisant language.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_30_0	“Sailor” was given as an example of a fixed-English word which would serve as a counterpart of “matelot.” “Sailor” is the most general, least highly coloured of the many words which roughly mean “4 man whose life is the sea,” such as “seaman, ‘‘boatman,” ‘‘mariner,” “seafarer,’ ‘‘shipman,” “voyager.” But even “sailor” has its peculiar senses: for instance a “‘good sailor” is not a “‘skilled seaman,” but a traveller who in his periodic voyages is not troubled by sea-sickness. “Glory” was also instanced as a fixed English counterpart of “la gloire.” But in English proper “glory” can mean almost anything according to the context. It can mean “heroic fame” in the emotional sense. ‘Through deadly Russian shot and Cossack spears, We carved our way to glory” is the theme of an old-fashioned barrack-room ballad. But “heroic fame” is an idea that, though it may survive in Italy and France, is almost extinct in modern England. “Glory” is far more often used in a satiric sense. “He was in his glory,” we might say, “taking his motor cycle to pieces and getting smothered with oil”; meaning by this, that he was whole-heartedly absorbed, regardless of consequences. Or “glory” can be used poetically. “Do not forget,’ writes A. E., the Irish mystical poet, “to leave a glory on the air when the red Gaelic sun has set.” Here “glory” is almost a colour.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_31_0	The long light shakes across the lakes, And the wild cataract leaps in glory
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_32_0	are lines of Tennyson’s, where “glory” means a “wild freedom.” And then by a whimsical trick of language “glory” can come to mean death and utter annihilation. ‘‘He dropped a cigaretteend into the powder-barrel and was blown to glory.” The case of the “Hand of Glory” (the severed hand of a hanged man soaked in oil and used as a magic torch by thieves) is rather more difficult. Hand of Glory is a translation of the French “main de gloire,” a popular corruption of “mandragore,” the plant mandragora, whose roots had a similar magic value to thieves. The word “glory” is here understood in a double or triple sense: as the glory or shining of the torch, as the death from which the hand has been snatched, and as the glorious success which the charm is expected to bring. The word “glory-hole,” meaning a cell where condemned prisoners are put, has the “death” sense; but the hopelessness and confusion of the glory-hole has applied the word to any receptacle in which possessions are put away in disorder.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_33_0	A word like “brazen” is perhaps easier to follow in its changes than “slory.” “Brazen” means “of brass” or “like brass.”” All the qualities therefore which the imagination can give to brass are latent inthe word. “Brazen” may mean “shining with a metallic glare,” as in the phrase, “There was a brazen gleam in the sky.” Or it may mean “strident,” by recollection of the noise that a brazen trumpet or bugle makes; as in “The brazen-throated bull.” Or it may mean “cased with brass,” and therefore “shameless and insolent”; as in “You brazen-faced impostor.” It may mean “of less worth than gold”; so Sir Philip Sidney writes in the essay already quoted: “Nature never set forth the earth in so rich a tapestry as divers poets have done, Her world is brazen: the poets only deliver a golden.”
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_34_0	It is the persistent use of this method of “thought by association of images” as opposed to “thought by generalised preconceptions” that distinguishes English proper from the more logical languages. Of course not even French started logical: its early employment of the imaginative method shows still in the number of fixed meanings a word like “jeu” or “‘siége” still keeps. But “jeu” or “‘siége” have come to this, that they are no longer single words with several meanings, but groups of several distinct words that happen to coincide in the same verbal form. Except in argot, which is only rarely allowed to refresh literary French, the language is steady enough and secure enough against imaginative interruption.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_35_0	The logical objection to this method of thought by association of images is that not only do the images tend to falsify the argument, but actual confusion is caused when a literal and not a figurative statement is intended, or when there may be a choice between two figurative senses of the word employed. Even in poetry, it will be maintained by some, there must be no possibility of confusion: and if by “slory” is meant the “glamour of bonfires after victory,” or “utter absorption in triumph,” or “wild freedom,” or “death, the too frequent accompaniment of glory,” or anything else, then the sense should be clearly expressed in these actual terms. The English answer to this is, that the use of a less vivid word will always be a blunting of the sense intended, and in practice, once the principle is recognised, mistakes are not as frequent as would appear. For instance, “morning, noon, and night” is a phrase meaning “unwearyingly,” or more than that, “wearisomely.” Therefore the English medical man would not instruct his patients to take certain arsenic pills “morning, noon, and night”; he would choose the phrase, “To be taken three times a day”; and no lives would be lost, But he would prefer the phrase, “That patient gives me no peace: he rings me up morning, noon, and night to inquire about his treatment” to “He rang me up three times to-day,”’ which would not express the annoyance that he felt.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_36_0	The fits of tidiness that come over the educated classes occasionally, and the efforts of the individual scholars who work in a missionary spirit to remodel the language, have been mentioned. But the scholars are unfortunately not always in agreement: against those who wish to Latinise or neoGallicise English are ranged enthusiasts for words of Anglo-Saxon or Norman-French origin, like Charles Doughty, whose travels in Arabia Deserta were undertaken mainly “to redeem English from the slough into which it has fallen since the time of Spenser,” and like Gill who wrote in 1619 in his Logonomia to complain of
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_37_0	"the “new mange in speaking and writing:"""
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_38_0	O harsh lips! I now hear all around me such words as common, vices, envy, malice ; even virtue, study, justice, pity, mercy, compassion, profit, commodity, colour, grace, favour, accepiance. But whither, I pray in all the world, have you banished those words which our forefathers used for these newfangled ones? Are our words to be exiled like our citizens? Is the new barbaric invasion to extirpate the English tongue? O ye Englishmen, on you, I say, I call in whose veins that blood flows, retain, retain what yet remains of our native speech, and whatever vestiges of our forefathers are yet to be seen, on these plant your footsteps.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_39_0	There is a pretty irony which must not be missed in “exiled,” “barbaric,” “invasion,” ‘‘extirpate,’ “‘vestiges.” Against the “abundance of polysyllables introduced by the late war, speculations, operations, preliminaries, ambassadors, communication, circumvallation, battalions,” we find Swift humorously protesting in his “ Bickerstaff Papers”: and at the same time against such slang words as banter, uppish, bamboozle, kidney, mob, sham, bully, shuffling, and palming, but vainly enough despite his great literary reputation, Perhaps English is by writers or public Speakers who, without making linguistics their special study, turn aside occasionally to put a wobbling word firmly on its feet. One of these will, for instance make a formal distinction between two divergent senses of the same word, and will find a new word to take over the newer of these senses. When the word “chalky”? came to be used chiefly in the sense of “dull white in colour,” another word was needed by geologists to mean simply “composed of chalk,” and some eatly writer coined the word “cretaceous” for this particular purpose, borrowing from the Latin. Again, a modern psychologist finding that the word “unconscious” was ambiguous, as meaning either “having the senses completely dulled” or “‘being unaware of some particular event,” decided to revive the somewhat old-fashioned word “unwitting” in this second sense. So, also, a word like “soul” is supplemented by secular coinages referring to the same essential life-principle in man but without theological encumbrances. By a particular declaration of this sort, or by tacit consent without, apparently, particular
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_39_1	record, assistance is given to the words most overworked. The word “can” now merely means to be able or permitted to do something: its sense of “knowing” has been handed over to “ken”: and of “getting to know” to “con.” “Brazen” is relieved of a good deal of its pressure by other forms such as “brassy,” “brass-like,” or “brass,” and by the nouns “‘brasswork” and “brass” used as adjectives. Each form has its own slightly different character. ‘This explains the paradox that a language which will loosely use the same word in many different senses has a tendency to become more copious than the logical languages which devote one word as far as possible to one sense.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_40_0	For the coining of a new idiom, for a new distinction between allied forms of the same word, for the importation of a word from a foreign language with or without alteration of spelling, an Englishman has great liberty. He must only satisfy his neighbours or colleagues that the coining, the definition, the importation, the spelling have a Strict necessity. ‘The only proof of necessity will be that the new form is generally adopted. A friend of mine needing to sum up aptly for my benefit the quality in film-acting that Harold Lloyd has borrowed from Charles Chaplin, described it at first by saying that they both are professional “poor deyils,” and exploit the tragi-comic sympathy of the audience for their “poor-devilment.” ‘‘Poor-devilment” seemed a somewhat awkward phrase, and my friend on second thoughts substituted the Yiddish word “Nebishkeit”: it had exactly the required sense. Then, if writing to some reputable journal or speaking in a public lecture-hall my friend were now to declare with sufiicient assurance “The quality that Messrs Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton have lately rather unsuccessfully borrowed from Charles Chaplin ‘is his Nebtshkeit,” the word would, likely enough, find its way into the jargon of professional film-critics and into the dictionary.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_41_0	This practice of making new words by declaration is of long standing. For example the word “mumpsimus,” meaning “an erroneous doctrinal view obstinately adhered to,” was put into currency first by Henry VIII in a speech fromthe Throne in 1545. He remarked, “Some be too stiff in their old mumpsimus, others be too busy and curious in their sumpsimus.” He referred to a familiar story in the jest-books of a priest who on being corrected for reading in the Mass “quod in ore mumpsimus” instead of “quod in ore sumpsimus,’ his Missal being mis-copied, replied that he had read it with an m for forty years, “and I will not change my old mumpsimus for ‘your new sumpsimus.” ‘The word has held its own since, but the doctrinal sense has lost’ its importance compared with the scholastic sense: it now means “an established manuscript-reading that, though obviously incorrect, is retained blindly by old-fashioned scholars.”
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_42_0	In other countries the declaration of an individual is not enough to settle a word, even though this is built up regularly from native material or crectly formed from Latin or Greek The declaration has to be endorsed by government decree or the recommends, tion of a university committee or learned society. The French Dictionary is a formal code: the English Dictionary, though in part a code (for science, law, and education make certain strong demands), is very largely a catalogue of precedents not yet distinctly codified.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_43_0	The growth of the label system of language, with its objection to the associative method, is parallel and contemporary with the growth of the rationalistic system of thought as opposed to that of sympathetic magic. In places where sympathetic magic survives in superstition the associative method of language will be found strongest. The peasantry, children, and other superstitious sections of a civilised community are the most prolific makers of words by the associative method; the rationalistic section, the academic and bureaucratic classes, borrow words from the superstitious sections and give them a fixed value, but, as we have seen, more readily in England than elsewhere; or “form” words from combinations of existing words in their own or a dead language; or they import foreign words, , but, again, more readily in England than elsewhere. In England the rationalistic class is less powerful than in France and Germany: and this seems to be the reason for the failure of fixed English to make more ground than it has done. It is possible that what is called a “good education” will eventually be the fate of every member of the English civilised community, and that rationalism will stop up the accustomed wells of language. When this happens, there is an end of English proper, and a great shrinking in the annual increase of the dictionary. But at the present time even the “best educations,” as given at the Public Schools, are still strongly coloured with medizval superstition and primitive taboo, and though
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_43_1	a violent reaction from such education produces a small number of very independent minds, clear thinking on rational lines by individuals is not a national habit. Perhaps national Foote’s panjandrum, Carroll’s jabbep. wocky and chortle, Lear’s runcible and scroobious, and Samuel Butler’s yknarc Carroll was an Oxford professor of mathematics, whose whimsicality was more than a mere relief from his professional functions. The Alices are rich in disguised philosophic speculation, and active if often unwitting criticism of contemporary thought and manners. The passage of which this digression on whimsicality interrupted the quotation, is a dialogue between Humpty-Dumpty, a character representing the poetic tragi-comic element in English, and Alice, the matter-of-fact reasoning child :—
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_44_0	Humpty-Dumpty said: “ There’s glory for you.” “I don’t know what you mean by ‘glory,’” Alice said. Humpty-Dumpty smiled contemptuously. ““Of course you don’t—till I tell you. I meant, ‘There’s a nice knock-down argument for you!’” “ But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice knock-down argument,’” Alice objected. “When / use a word,” Humpty-Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.” “The question is,” said Alice, “ whether you can make words mean so many different things.” “The question is,” said Humpty-Dumpty, “which is to be Master—that’s all.” Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty-Dumpty began again, “They've a temper, some of them—particularly verbs, they’re the proudest—adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs —however, J can manage the whole lot of them! IMPENETRABILITY! That’s what I say!”
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_45_0	"""Would you tell me, please,” said Alice, “what that means?” “Now you talk like a reasonable child,” said Humpty-Dumpty, looking very much pleased. “I meant by ‘impenetrability’ that we’ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as I don’t suppose you mean to stop here the rest of your life.” “That’s a great deal to make one word mean,” Alice said in a thoughtful tone. “When I make a word do a lot of work like that,” said Humpty Dumpty, “I always pay it extra.” “Oh!” said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark. “Ah, you should see ’em come round me of a Saturday night,” Humpty-Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side, “for to get their wages, you know.”"
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_46_0	The first part of this passage need little explanation in the light of wh 8 has already been said of the fluidity of English proper, but it adds two te portant points. The first is the suggestion that verbs are less subject to imaginative changes than nouns and adjectives: this is a sound one, as the dictionary shows: yet even verbs are tamed of much of their pride by being coupled with prepositions; for instance, to get at, to get out, to get through, to get along, to get along with, to get out of, to get round, to get up, to get down, to get over, to get with, to get in have such different senses as to seduce, to dismiss, to complete, to succeed, to suit, to evade, to deceive, to learn by heart, to reduce, to be recovered, to impregnate, to store, and most of these combinations have two quite different meanings according as their use is transitive or intransitive. Nor are verb-terminations secure against imaginative use. Mr E. B. Osborn records a popular gem: “In Cardiff when it rains, indeed it raineth,” where “raineth” implies a Biblical and therefore a very heavy rain; a deluge. The other point is raised by ““impenetrability ”’: even scholarly words formed from Latin or Greek for exact technical use have a tendency to take queer popular turns. Often—as, for instance, the words ‘‘sanguine,” “quintessence, ” “jovial,” “omen,” mystery ” — they survive by centuries the philosophic or religious system on
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_46_1	which they began. We must expect Freudian psychology when scientifically exploded to leave its clear mark on the language.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_47_0	But the last sentence of the HumptyDumpty passage — Carroll admits that it reads nonsensically to a practical mind — must be commented on at greater length. When particular words very highly charged with meaning in their context occur in English literature, this is counted a great virtue. In logical literatures it is a vice, by the rule of “one word, one meaning.” For instance, in Keats’ Eve of St Agnes, Madeline is described in “her soft and chilly nest,” “Clasped like a missal when swart Paynims pray,” where “clasped” means “fastened with a clasp of holiness” or “held lovingly in the hands,” if the Paynims are held to be converted; but also, without prejudice, “shut and coldly neglected,” if the Paynims are held to be unconverted. A simpler phrase, met somewhere recently, is “Beauty’s temporal rose,” and can be examined in the same way. “Temporal” is a word first meaning “lasting for a time,” then meaning, like “temporary,” “lasting onlyforatime.” But “temporary” and “temporal” are instances of what has already been said about similar words becoming by public declaration or tacit consent distinguished from each other and given separate functions to perform. The contrary of “temporary” is “permanent,” in a finite sense of “permanent.” The contrary of “temporal” is “eternal.” ‘Temporal joys” are not to be compared with the “joys of eternity,” or so religion advises us, nor are “temporal powers” deserving of reverence in comparison with “eternal powers.” So to call Beauty’s rose temporal is in a somewhat
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_47_1	archaistic style to call it “fleeting” or “short lived”; but also to compare the vanities of the flesh with the assured joys of the spirit.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_48_0	This, then, is the constant practice of those English poets who achieve the most admired phrases. The reader is not rationally aware of the principle underlying such phrases: he knows that they delight him but does not in the act of reading poetry dissect them. In prose a similar method of concentrated meaning is used and known as “wit,” but in this case the reader gets pleasure from a clear rational analysis of the different senses in which the witty phrase is to be read. Here is a passage from a superior society novel:
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_49_0	On departure our hero clicked his heels politely and acknowledged the salty hospitality of his host: for the old marquis had enjoyed the youth’s discomfiture hugely, and had been thus lavish in heaping him with all manner of delicacies and honours only because he knew that they afforded his guest no enjoyment at all.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_50_0	This word “salty” is the point where opposing senses unite in wit. To “acknowledge salty hospitality” is in one sense to acknowledge the social obligation of good manners which eating a host’s salt implies in most countries. But it is also to comment on the absence of goodwill, in the sense that ‘“‘salty” means “sterile.” In a third sense it is to comment on the host’s dry humour in recognising and making fun of the guest’s discomfiture, for “Attic salt” is a well-known synonym for wit itself, When such a concentration of forces can be exerted at a single point in literature, then, in Humpty-Dumpty’s _ words, “there’s glory for you!”—using “ glory” in yet another sense than the many we have defined. The word “habit” that heads this paper is serving three senses. It refers to the habiliments or dress of English, that is the actual word-forms ; to the general behaviour or carriage of the language; and to the habitual processes of thought which govern it. “Proper,” the adjective qualifying “habit,” has also three senses. It means “fitting,” it means “peculiar,” it means “‘distinguished.” It has even a fourth meaning, for all who know the language of heraldry, and that is ‘“‘blazoned in more than a single colour,” which is very appropriate here.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_51_0	I recently heard it charged against an American poet that she “puts more on English than it will bear.” That is not a properly worded charge. English is strong enough to bear any weight so long as the load is properly packed and adjusted. Its greatest virtue as a literary language is its readiness to absorb foreign and technical words, and words from the better sort of slang, and to extemporise not only new imaginative phrases but distinguishable varieties of any overworked or ambiguous word, drawing on four languages for the body of the word or the termination. It can accomplish these feats and the greater feat of improvising new grammatic constructions, new suffixes and ‘prefixes, and remain all the more stubbornly English. Among recent anomalies that have appeared in the language may be mentioned the emphasised “some”; as in “some fool. meaning “‘what a great fool”: the threat “‘Which would you rather or a your ears boxed?”, meaning “I intend to box your ears without alternative”. and the scornful apposition of “Philosophy nothing” or “Philosophy my aunt,” giving a purer sense of scorn than “Philosophy, I account it nothing” or “Philosophy, it is the hobby of my aunt.”
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_52_0	The logical languages usually have a high protective tariff against new importations. The result is that English under linguistic Free Trade has a more frequent turn-over of its current wealth. It shows period more easily: it adopts and discards. Partly as a result of this rapid turn-over of language, partly because of the individual’s claim to his own peculiar vocabulary, partly because of the wide distribution of the English language in all climates and among many races, there is nowhere to be found a reputable standard English prose: never more than the literary prose of a given group of writers or of a particular writer at any given period. One may, if desired, write like a Euphuist of early Elizabethan times, or like a Civil War pamphleteer, or in the Defoe manner, or like an eighteenth-century divine, or like an Early Victorian romance-writer, or in the style of Pater or of Doughty or the leader-writer of the Egyptian Gazette. Conrad did no more in fixing English than Addison did two centuries before him. English proper moves on with fixed English reluctantly following, and Conrad is left merely as another “personal style’; each of which styles (many as they are and only bound to each other by the weakest of ties) is recognised as good English.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_53_0	The best English is attained not by a faithful approximation to a discovered and acknowledged standard of excellence but by the formation of a personal style and vocabulary which, while avoiding offence to precedent and tradition, is fittest for the writer’s immediate needs.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_54_0	This is far from being a free pass to literary licence, as one soon discovers: few writers contrive to form their own style beyond making it a patchwork of the styles of other writers. And Pre. cedent is a very severe custodian to the gate of Reputation and only appeased by constant observation and study, Such is the habit of English. Its muddled origin must be accepted in Shakespeare’s words :—
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_55_0	I would not wish the fault undone: the issue of it being so proper.
2-3-impenetrability	doc_15_56_0	But this without disrespect to French and other languages, each of which, to air a final commonplace, is the necessary and peculiar expression of the national habit of mind. An international language in the present nationalistic civilisation cannot hope to be a very subtle or personal vehicle, and as a literary language is a thousand years off.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_0_0	THE NATURE OF BEAUTY IN LITERATURE AND ART
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_1_0	PREFACE
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_2_0	A word of introduction, of apology perhaps, seems appropriate in “asking English readers to pay attention to the ideas of a young French writer who is known as yet only to a small circle of his fellow-countrymen. The excuse, if excuse is necessary, is that M. Mauron brings to these interminably, and so often fruitlessly, discussed questions a combination of faculties which is unusual. Soon after he had taken his degree he made his mark in the scientific world by an important discovery in physical chemistry, being the first to control the passage of matter from a crystalloid to a colloid state. A brilliant career lay before him when the menace of blindness put an end to all possibility of continuing his researches, Fortunately for him, chemistry, in which he had made such rapid progress, had not been his first study. He had approached science through the Humanities, and his passion for literature and the plastic arts was at least as strong as his love of science. He brought to his renewed contemplation of the nature of literary and plastic beauty that unhesitating confidence in experimental methods and that precision of thought with which his scientific work had endowed him.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_3_0	As may be seen in his essay on the ““Nature of Beauty in Literature,” M. Mauron uses the methods of the exact sciences with a boldness which may likely enough shock those who have approached these questions only from the standpoint of literature and art. To such the analogy is suspect from its use as a rhetorical device for persuasion or at best for the illumination of an already acquired-idea. Here it is a technical instrument. M. Mauron trusts himself to it — like those spiders which venture on their air-borne thread — in order to bridge a chasm in our understanding. He looks to it not to persuade others, but actually to reveal to himself hitherto unsuspected rela| tions. The results which this method yields in our author’s hands seem to me full of interest for our understanding of the aesthetic problem.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_4_0	But M. Mauron’s interest in so many diverse aspects of the spiritual life have given him far more than a facility in experimental methods. Unlike too many scientific practitioners he is deeply imbued with the scientific spirit. The constructions of science and art are for him the two great means for the liberation and self-realisation of the human spirit. It is this deep imaginative conviction, together with the candour and freshness of his outlook, which makes M. Mauron’s speculations so fascinating to follow and so full of promise by reason of the prospects of further inquiry which they open to the mind.

2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_6_0	UNITY AND DIVERSITY IN ART
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_7_0	I
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_8_0	In aesthetics, as indeed elsewhere, there is only one honest method—the experimental. All the a priori affirmations of dubious metaphysics and inopportune ethics are puerile impertinences. One must feel, and feel for a long while, descend to technical considerations, and linger in the laboratory. Then only may one philosophise if one can, for it is no easy matter.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_9_0	A man of the eighteenth century, without museums, without exhibitions, without photographs, and almost without music, could, if he tried, arrive at certain limited formulae. Voltaire could talk of Lully but not of Palestrina, of Poussin but not of Fra Angelico, and had he done so it would almost surely have been beside the mark. Not that great works had not been created before then, but the knowledge of them was not public and ideas like collections were private.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_10_0	We know and feel to-day so large a number of aesthetic phenomena that the primitive hypotheses, filled to overflowing, have burst. We need hypotheses, however, as we need a house, were it only to taste the pleasures of irony and the open sky. We desire even to have only one, for our minds have grasped the certitude of the unity of all the arts. But what idea is large enough to contain at once Bach and Debussy, Rubens and Giotto, Milton and Verlaine? One may risk the venture, but only on condition of making, before one starts, good provision of intellectual honesty, of abandoning all pride and all hope of absolute success, of being happy if one finds, not the formula, but a few honest phrases which are not too absurd.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_11_0	The great danger, in face of so many and such various facts, is to suppose that what we call the aesthetic sense is a form of intelligence. We love unity; in it we repose and by it we are nourished. ‘To succeed in proving that A = B, or at least enters into B, wards off that fear which every original existence awakes in us—the fear of the unknown. To prove that art is, at bottom, the analogue of science, that Baudelaire = Lord Kelvin, and Shakespeare = Leibnitz — what beatitudes were there! ‘The idea is so seductive that it is difficult to suppose it absurd; nor is it absurd. ‘The source of every intellectual production is always that inexhaustible reservoir of sensations which we call nature. As for the human intelligence, it must be a machine that is always more or less similar, more or less pointed or powerful in different individuals, but constant, like the species, in its mechanism. If, then, there is unity of origin and unity of treatment, how should there not be unity of result? There we have a good example of a priori reasoning. It would have no value — because one can, at will, by the balance of the phrase bring into relief the unity or the diversity of the human spirit—if the theory and practice of certain modern painters had not supplied a kind of experimental confirmation of the idea.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_12_0	A current opinion of the day is that a picture is not the reproduction of nature but a deformation of nature, a kind of extract destined to bring into relief certain relations which would otherwise be lost among insignificant details. If a group of trees, it is said, owes its aesthetic value in an ensemble only to the sombre masses of its foliage, what is gained by a detailed description of the branches and bark? A few indications will suffice. To keep only what is efficient, to put nothing on the canvas but the harmony which arrested the artist, would be, according to these theories, the means of attaining to that sober strength, that fullness of form which distinguishes good architecture and, in general, all classic works of art.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_13_0	An argument once started ends generally by plunging down unforeseen declivities. And most people precipitate themselves after it; a few only watch it roll, not without a certain sadness and perhaps an excessive contempt. Modern theories of painting make straight for Cubism, and I doubt if any reasonable argument has been found to bar the way. If an object counts only by its . Shape and colour, it is of little importance if it be an object or not; it is purely shape and colour, and one can place it beside other shapes and other colours without any signification; they are chosen by the painter only to satisfy his sense of harmony.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_14_0	It is enough to choose, it is enough to compose. Such is the irresistible conclusion which is the more seductive in that it passes beyond the limits of painting. It explains music, it may be adapted to poetry. Even more, it is only the emergence into the painter’s consciousness, and the application to his craft of familiar psychological truths. To choose out of a natural ensemble, to abstract, to rearrange, in order to bring out certain relations, is what we do every day. These are the incessantly repeated gestures of the human mind, the very movements of his mental mechanism. One can watch them, for instance, in the domain of science, where these gestures have become extremely conscious. In the simple experiment of the fall of bodies in vacuo, the experimenter, when he considers the tube, eliminates its form, its colour, its hardness, and a thousand other qualities so as to see in it only a circumscribed vacuum. Of the falling bodies he considers only that they are as different as possible and, above all, in their mass; of their fall, of that bunch of sensations which is composed of noises, reflected lights, and shades, he considers only the rapidity. Unceasingly the experimenter chooses so as to bring out the simple relation: all bodies fall in vacuo with the same rapidity. And here we are at the heart of the question. It is evident that it is this skilful choice, this arrangement, which is the basis of science. If one
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_14_1	can show that these also constitute art we have found the trunk whence the two branches grow. We re-establish unity, we identify, we explain; our mind can rest at ease, we are happy. An a priori reasoning is the safe road to happiness.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_15_0	But let us submit the case to experiment. Let us question our sensations. Let us consider simply, without any theories in mind, the two results that we wish to identify. The end of science is law; more still it is a mathematical formula. It aims at the establishment of a universal function which would allow us to foresee at each instant the state of the universe. Since it is impossible for the moment to attain to this function, of which we know neither the variables nor the form, we have subdivided the universe into a certain number of domains, and we seek in each of these domains to find the general function which controls it. Scientific knowledge is thus only complete in the most abstract mathematical form. And who would complain that it is simple? As far as knowledge is concerned, one can only rejoice that between the pressure, P, of a gas, the volume, V, and the temperature, T, there should exist so simple a relation as PV=RT where R is a constant. The simpler the result the more we applaud. But what theory would be persuasive enough to make us admit that such schematic results, however potent, would satisfy us in art, and that a formula in physics could be in any way compared to a portrait by Rembrandt? We feel at once that a fundamental heterogeneity separates them. We feel clearly that the details so necessarily eliminated from the formula ought to be retained in an aesthetic
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_15_1	construction. That they must be chosen as being necessary to the ensemble and concurrent with the total harmony is true, but we must have details. We want order in variety, but without variety order is quite useless. A critic once said of Cézanne that when he painted apples he neglected their terrestrial and ephemeral qualities to preserve only their eternal form. But if the sight of an apple is a trivial occurrence of every day, what is there so strange about a sphere?
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_16_0	Whatever is dry, linear, precise, anaemic is detestable in art. It is not that the work must be sensual. Le Misanthrope is not sensual, and with obstinate good sense we insist on living novels — dramatis persone which are not arguments incostume. We want forms more succulent than dihedral angles, a music which is not merely made up of learned harmonies. We require richness; we demand, in fine, that a work of art should nourish us as real things do, and that we can have the divine experience of it as we have of the actual world.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_17_0	All this is excessively banal, but is there any better sign of an experimental truth than its banality? But we must avoid misunderstanding. A “living” novel is not the realistic mirror in which we find once more a too well-known face. To wish for succulent forms is not to ask the painter to reproduce beautiful models. Keeping to the strict sense of words, to say that a work of art should be real and should be able to form part of our experience is to ask of it only that it should have the qualities of an external object, at once original and complex. That is not a theory, but a quite ordinary constatement.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_18_0	Call to mind the way in which any beautiful work presents itself to you. One happens upon it on one’s Way as one happens on a new person. On its face are inimitable lights and shades, with resemblances to others, no doubt, but always a personality. It has its own life, and thousands of imperceptible influences have modelled the contours of its face—a thousand events of which you are necessarily ignorant, but whence you derive a total impression. If you cease to look at it, you know that others look at it in their turn and see it differently from you; and if you look at it twenty times, you find it always at once familiar and different.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_19_0	It is never thus that a scientific law or formula, however subtle its relations, presents itself to our minds. There, all the elements are definite and their relations are definite. You may or may not understand it, but once understood, it remains within you as immutable as the letters that symbolise it. It is necessary to bring into relief those fundamental qualities, however familiar, in order to explore more fully this idea of what is real and endeavour to discover what exactly distinguishes an external object from an_ intellectual construction. We have a chance thus to be able to define better than by a sensation this condition of reality which seems to be fundamental to a work of art.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_20_0	An example will make this clearer. If we consider a circle we see clearly that it is entirely determined when one knows the definition of a circle and knows also the centre and the radius. We can probe the reality it offers us as long as we like, we shall never get anything out other than this definition, and even the form of the definition will be sensibly the same. Moreover, with the same elements we are able at will to superpose an infinite number of identical circles. But place beside the circle the contour of a leaf. It is simple enough to the eye, although we cannot define its curve in intelligible words. If we examine it with a microscope it appears made up of the sequence of contours of the cells, which are themselves undefinable (in the interior of each cell the protoplasm disposes its granulations by chance), and one may continue the process to infinity. We know, moreover, that the whole tree cannot provide us with another leaf whose contour could be superposed on this one.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_21_0	One may repeat the same reasoning for all intellectual constructions on the one hand, and for all real objects on the other. What distinguishes them in essence is that one is simple enough to be defined in its elements and their relations, whilst the other offers us a complexity which renders it inimitable. It is very possible that one could pass by successive complications from this simple thing to the composite. The complexity of a phenomenon may be incomprehensible to us without being infinite. The human mind is an instrument which has limits to its precision, and we must take account of these. For the photographic objective infinity begins at seven metres; for our intellect it is enough to have three bodies acting on one another to make the problem of their movements insoluble. As soon, then, as a phenomenon becomes sufficiently complex to be incomprehensible, it enters into the domain where a work of art becomes possible. It can become an aesthetic fact —which does not mean that it must become one. We can only say of any construction of the human spirit that, in so far as it puts off its abstract character and takes on the qualities of a real object, it becomes inimitable.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_22_0	We have seen already in regard to the preceding example how an increasing complication brought about increasing chances of originality. It is evident to anyone who realises the astonishing progression of possible combinations.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_23_0	Whatever is purely intellectual is never original. A mathematical formula, a scientific law, uses only elements that are definite, clear, and comprehensible to all. How can we conciliate the general and the particular? We must choose one or the other—idea or sensation, relations or living things. In thus opposing our aesthetic experience to the endeavour to reduce art to purely intellectual elements, we have, to start with, only translated an indisputable impression—viz. that the work of art must be a part of reality. But when, having examined the meaning of the word reality, and having found it almost synonymous with inexhaustible complexity, we say, further, that the work of art must possess this complexity, we are formulating a hypothesis. And this hypothesis will have value, not if it is true — there are so many indisputable propositions without interest—but if it explains and co-ordinates a certain number of sensations without contradicting any one which is essential. It is this that we must now investigate. Perhaps before examining the facts which may support or contradict our hypothesis we must avoid a misunderstanding, without serious importance, It is true, but capable of interfering with our comprehension of the problem. One might say that, no matter what work of art, good or bad, will possess the complexity of real objects, since It itself is one. One sees at once the sophism. When we consider a statue it is the form that interests us, not the stone; it is the form which must possess
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_23_1	this necessary complexity. Matter cannot confer it. And in the form itself it is the intention that counts. A cube may have its corners chipped; it is none the less a cube for the spirit. Every complexity to count must be voluntary and not accidental.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_24_0	II
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_25_0	We can now try our hypothesis. Everyone can first of all see if it holds when he applies it successively to all the works of art he knows. I doubt if any can be resolved into merely intelligible relations; but this is only our first impression made more precise and extensive. There is, too, the incapacity in art of all automatism. We may range under this heading the most diverse facts. There is the painter’s love of what he calls a sensitive line, his horror of the compass, his exclusive interest in what is manual; there is the musician’s love for phrases with unforeseen modulations; there is the impossibility of manufacturing art by machine, and even by hand if one uses only geometric drawings. A problem which has haunted all those who are interested without prejudice in aesthetics is that of the à peu prés in art. Nothing in it is exact. We talk frequently of symmetry, equilibrium, and proportions in art, but it is useless to try to discover the sense and range of these terms, which never have in their context the rigorous meaning we give them. Symmetry very roughly observed is generally only suggestive. Not that the artist lacks means; it is with evident intention that the order is broken. Still more, it is just that that charms us. On one side of the porch are the Elect, on the other the Damned. The general movement is repeated on either side, but the attitudes are very different.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_25_1	Similarly in a sonata, the motive recurs only in a different key or with modifications, which symmetry allows us to feel and which we enjoy as much as it. We may say it is to avoid monotony, but the whole question lies there. Who would ever talk of the monotony of a formula? Symmetry has a geometrical interest only if it is absolutely exact; it seems to have aesthetic interest only if it is not. And what balance could estimate the equilibrium of a work of art? It is made, not for an instrument of knowledge, but for a sensitive eye whose optic nerve ends in a thinking brain. To natural complexity there is added spiritual complexity. Most objects are modified by their colour and their import for human beings. One speaks, indeed, of relations and proportions, and one must admit that we have no other words; but how vague and indetermined a meaning must be allowed when we talk of the proportions of a figure to a landscape! Its meaning is altogether qualitative. Possibly, indeed almost certainly, it is a question of respective dimensions. But what formula could ever make explicit the dimensions of a human body and those of the surrounding landscape seen in perspective? To know that such a formula exists is but a Platonic satisfaction. A chemist, too, may have an intimate conviction that there exists a formula for wood; but, since he does not know it, he is content to admire its fibres and its
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_25_2	texture, which cannot enter into any scientific construction. And even if he found the formula it would give him only the chemical composition, and would not explain to him the movement of its fibres and the colour of its grain. The intelligibility which it would bring would be so minute beside the infinity of the real object that one could never imagine it would explain its beauty! On this point many contemporary works of art which show remarkable intelligence and ingenuity and a quick sense of relations, but which fail of being genuine creations, would seem to be fairly conclusive. One has before them the feeling that when once one has understood the relations there is an end of it. It is this which explains, too, that among the works of the old masters so many learned constructions, so many “big machines’”’—the artist’s slang is itself expressive of our idea—remain forgotten, whilst many smaller works continue to charm us because a living sensibility has put into them that infinite complexity which the intellect cannot attain to. Even if we consider an art which is more intelligible, like architecture, this idea that beauty comes from happy proportions appears insufficient. It is certain that the three dimensions of a room ought to be chosen according to aesthetically correct relations, but could this simple volume alone give us the sensation of beauty? In that which we feel in the interior of a cathedral there is not merely a relation of proportions; there is
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_25_3	light and shade, there are the ribs whereon these play, and it is quite possible that its beauty when orientated from East to West would be lessened if it lay North and South. What architect’s “plan, section, and elevation,” where the relations are none the less exactly reproduced, could give us in the least the impression of the actual monument? And how fallacious we feel those geometric schemes to be by which, recently, people have tried to interpret the masterpieces of painting! To begin with, the work does not agree with the schema, and, moreover, we feel that starting from the most perfect schema in the world one could never create such a picture! All those facts, all these infallible sensations, converge towards the idea of a necessary complexity. If the aim of science is the creation of a formula, that of art is the creation of an object. And besides, is there not in each domain parallel to its art a science which handles the same material? There exists a science of forms, but if anyone ever thought of employing for aesthetic ends the results of descriptive geometry he could not, I think, realise anything very felicitous. Similarly, we have never seen that progress in acoustics has intervened in the progress of music; and harmony itself — so useful for composition, so prominent in the musicians’ craft — do we not know that its laws may be perfectly observed in a work of no musical value whatever?
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_26_0	It is a terrible poser for the partisans of a purely intellectual art to explain why so much science, so subtle and so profound, can at times appear so vain. It is, indeed, because one can add as many terms as one likes to a formula; it never can in any way attain to the character of a sensation.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_27_0	Here then are resumed, I think, most of the facts which support our hypothesis. But can one perhaps raise against it a serious objection? I mean, does it omit no essential fact? I only see one, but that a very important one: if complexity is a necessary condition of art, how is it that the most striking characteristic of many beautiful works is precisely their simplicity? The sensation of beauty that comes from them seems precisely to be derived from the fact that they are largely and lucidly constructed. But we have already sufficiently insisted on the sense here given to the words simple and complex to prevent anyone saying that such works are, in our sense, simple. A fresco by Giotto, though we call it simple in design, has none the less the complicated and subtle curves of a living thing. The objection under this heading, then, falls to the ground. But when one makes this objection, one may have in view most of all the example of our religious architecture, which in passing from the Romanesque through Gothic to the Flamboyant enriches itself continually with fresh complications in proportion as, generally speaking, its beauty grows less. Is not that a progression exactly the opposite of what the preceding ideas would lead us to expect? The objection is strong and will, in fact, complicate our hypothesis and make it more precise. The creation of a work of art is certainly a happy concurrence. It is a phenomenon which, according
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_27_1	to what we have already said, is more related to biological than purely intellectual facts. And we know how for the birth of a new creature, a series of conditions is necessary, of which each one, not only is not sufficient, but also may be harmful to all the others and compromise the general equilibrium if it develops in an abnormal way.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_28_0	To say that a certain complexity is necessary is to mark an inferior limit in the series of increasing complexities. There ought to exist a second, very variable no doubt, in order to define the region wherein the work of art can exist. There must be for it a vital zone placed between the Formula and Chaos, and experience alone can fix its limits. We have already noticed, too, the hypothesis which acts as a counterweight to our own, order in opposition to complexity; whether attained by symmetry, however imperfect, or by choice of proportions, which is needful but in itself inadequate. It is precisely because a work of art is not the analogue of a chain of reasoning nor of a scientific law, but forms a part of objective reality that in it forces are opposed and in equilibrium. What unity can be stronger than that of a tree and what complexity greater? It was clear that in pushing our hypothesis we should meet with limitations as all living things must. And here another aesthetic question poses itself: that of the unity of the work of art. Whatever importance we attribute to that, it does not aftect the value of complexity any more than the role of temperature in germination is opposed to the different but equally necessary role of humidity.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_29_0	III
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_30_0	Besides the arguments of a general kind hitherto enumerated, one could certainly find facts supporting our hypothesis in the empirical aesthetics, which have been long ago laid down in each branch of art. It is thus that one could interpret the literary formula of the seventeenth century, which prescribed the strict following of nature. We know quite well that a mere copy of manners and characters offers no artistic interest, but if, instead of following step by step this precept, the artist dominates his subject as Moliére and Racine did, he may find in it a powerful means of obtaining the necessary complexity. A constant comparison between the work of art on the one hand and the spectacle which the world affords must conduce to a continual shading and modelling of the effects. It is not a question of imitating nature but of finding therein a school which nothing else can replace. Every art would afford similar examples in its technique.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_31_0	It may be worth while to examine one of these more closely in order to verify in detail the importance of our hypothesis. Of all the cases one might choose, that of the art of letters might seem, @ priori, the most difficult to reconcile with the preceding suggestions, since ideas themselves and their logical sequence play so great a part there that one is tempted to allow them a primordialimportance. It isa commonplace to say that the excellence of a writer shows itself among other things in the exactitude of his terminology, in the mot juste, and we are so confirmed in this idea of exactitude that we willingly allow it the same rigorous sense that it it would have if applied, for example, to a mathematical work.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_32_0	It seems as though a sensation or an emotion might be represented by a particular word as a geometrical figure or property is. But if one examines a the meaning of the expression mot a juste in this latter case, one finds that it implies nothing other than the possibility for the word in question to be replaced by its exact definition. The same remark applies for any scientific work. I find, for instance, in an article this simple phrase: “It has been found possible to cinematograph the flight of birds.” If one gives to the word flight its usual definition: “The movements made by a bird to maintain itself or to progress in the air,” one sees that there is no difficulty in replacing in the preceding phrase the word flight by its definition. But, on the other hand, let us take the verse in which Mallarmé says about his daughter’s fan:
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_33_0	Ce blanc vol fermé que tu poses Contre le feu d’un bracelet.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_34_0	If we try to repeat the same operation, not only does the phrase become ridiculous, which is a question of rhythm and need not be considered, but it becomes absurd. One might try other definitions. It is a simple experiment, but the result is always the same, and we are led to the surprising conclusion that the word is not capable of definition. It represents nevertheless a reality, and one that is evocative of very delicate sensations. It brings back to us those sensations of aerial lightness and rhythmic beats which we haye often experienced but which we could not exactly define. The example is taken at random, and anyone can repeat the experiment as often as he likes.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_35_0	He will thereby be led to see that every word is the symbol of two quite distinct realities: one, which I will call intellectual — the definition of the dictionary (though this is sometimes more than a definition, an explanation, where an acute apprehension of things is already apparent)—the other, which one may call poetic, which is the ensemble of the reactions of our sensibility before the objective realities which the words represent. I mean by this, in case of an object, the ensemble of the impressions experienced before this object; in the case of an emotion, the ensemble of those moments in which we have felt it, in short the experience we have of the thing named. The mind weaves between these diverse impressions—and without distinguishing the sensual from the emotive—more or less tenuous threads which cause each word to construct as an inner reality a kind of fragile system—often without any logic other than that of associations or partial resemblances—a system which would suggest to the chemist those enormous molecules which constitute living matter, whose groupings are so insecure and so complicated that the body undergoes incessant small changes, tightening here and loosening there, always analogous but never identical with itself and never defined. We find thus in a precise manner the fundamental dissimilarity between the products of science and those of art.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_36_0	It shows itself even in the words themselves, which can be according to the mind which employs them either geometrical figures or living protoplasm. One can see as a result in what sense one must understand the expression of the mot juste. If nothing is less defined, nothing is more delicate and more precise than a natural construction. One cannot enunciate the drawing of a face; one can only feel and savour it, but with what care must this be done in order to create a likeness. Similarly, a felicitous expression requires a delicate sensibility which will succeed where the most alert intellect could accomplish nothing.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_37_0	It is, moreover, not only in the words themselves that such misconceptions have arisen, it is also in what constitutes almost the essence of the art of unity, in the poetical image. People have crassly confused the poetical image with those comparisons which we constantly make in order to explain our thought. Let us take a very simple example, which has nothing of the rather precious complications of modern writers. Everyone knows the old rondeau of Charles d’Orléans:
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_38_0	Le temps a laissé son manteau De vent, de froidure, et de pluie!
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_39_0	Hardly a manual of literature but declares that the poet has personified the weather. But if it was so, and if that was the whole of the poetical image, what a poor impression it would make on us! We know only too well the factitious and ugly character of those symbolic figures which encumber the engravings and the bad verse of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, where one represents, of course, Commerce handing the products of Industry to naked savages, and Science contemplating a globe. And again they tell us that the image is visual, and they make it a great merit for the author. But if we try to see, we have got first of all to imagine the Weather for ourselves, since all we are told of him is that he had a cloak. And if we ask of what nature this cloak was and what was its form, we are told: “Of wind and cold and rain.” We can only feel puzzled, for how can we humanly conceive of a cloak made of cold. One could at a pinch suppose it made of snow or of mist, but here it is, I think, impossible to frame any clear image, and, moreover, the mind is perplexed by the contradiction implied in the expression “cloak of cold.” Must we conclude, then, as they certainly would have done in the eighteenth century, that the image is bad since it is neither visible nor comprehensible? Evidently not, for we have no
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_39_1	need either to imagine or to understand. It is enough to feel.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_40_0	The “ Weather” is not a kind of Goodfellow; it is what we all call the weather, that is to say the temperature, the force of the wind on our face and the colour of the sky; and the cloak—if we are content to listen to our spirit and let it do its own business —the cloak represents the most complete system of wintry sensations. It may be, it is true, the cloak of cloud which covers the wintry sky, but it is certainly also our own cloak; not indeed, as the dictionary would say, that warm garment which we cover ourselves with in winter, which would make the phrase ridiculous; it is our experience of the cloak, the wind which has lifted it and which it resembles moreover by its spreading gesture and its enveloping folds; it is the cold from which it has protected us and the rain on our faces, and besides this, making a background at once to our experience and the phrase, it is a thousand landscapes, shaken trees, and skies either grey or too icily blue; in short it is the weather of winter-time.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_41_0	To forget all these sensations, to leave them in the same cupboard as the woollens and furs and to see nothing but the white embroideries of a sunny sky or a woman’s dress, that is indeed for us the coming of spring. So that the two verses which have no other definable sense than that of the banal phrase “winter is over,” because they employ instead of words which are intellectual constructions other words stuffed for us with sensations and minute details, because they speak of that fundamental object our clothing, which we lighten or thicken according to the time or the season, contain a reality which makes of them a work of art. They would be poor enough if they only brought us an image and an allegory, but they are, in fact, a new original and complex method of expression. One may object, perhaps, that we are putting too many things into a few words, and that it is impossible to see all that in a simple reading of the verses. But did we see, in the contour of the leaf the cells and the granulation of the protoplasm which all the same gave its suppleness to the line? The poet feels what words are swollen with realities; it is when he finds them that he makes a beautiful work and not when his intellect discovers some ingenious comparison.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_42_0	When on any controverted issue one has sorted out one’s sincere impressions, analysed one’s sensations, tried a hypothesis, discussed and applied this hypothesis to particular cases in order to test its value, there remains apparently no more to be said. ‘There is, however, some advantage in carrying one’s philosophy further and giving the metaphysic, so to speak, of the experimental idea, because one shows more clearly thus its meaning and underlying tendencies. An idea never remains isolated; there is in it a force of attraction which makes it join with others in a system. It is only when it is thus classified in the totality of our conceptions that we really apprehend it in its entirety. Our hypothesis of a certain complexity being necessary to art relates itself inevitably to the thought, already an old one, that if the end of science is solely a knowledge of the existing world, art aims at a genuine creation. If we refuse to be stopped by the banality of words falsified by popular usage, we shall see that the formula is of inexhaustible wealth. The idea of “creation” contains, in fact, if one adds to it that of “play,” nearly all that man has hitherto been able to conceive of the divinity. From antiquity downwards there have always been certain spirits to whom the diverse ends which religion and morals have tried to make out for human activity have appeared too narrow. No one of these could contain it entirely, and one is
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_42_1	led to this conclusion that the highest aim which one can give to it, that which a god would give to his gestures, is nothing but this activity itself, or, if you like, the pleasure which one finds in exercising it—and this is nothing but its internal aspect, the view we have of it from within.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_43_0	Whatever the gods of antiquity do they play. And we too—actors of a miniature history which none the less surpasses us infinitely — we could not find a finer attitude. But when a spirit plays, it can only do so in two ways, either by regarding the preexisting world and marvelling at it, or seeking to comprehend it and foretell its events, or by dissociating this same world into its elements which he will employ to construct others from them according to his fancy, as a child destroys a pattern of coloured cubes to build up new ones. That, indeed, is a divine game, and it is the game of the artist. It is not without rules, and one can deduce at once that the new construction is valueless unless it has as forcible a reality as the original world.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_44_0	If one creates one must create a reality, and not, as painters say, cardboard. The face painted by Rembrandt has to be at least as rich as those we meet every day, or otherwise what do we gain? It is necessary, too, that this reality should be different from that which we find in the external world, and thereby we see that complexity is not sufficient by itself and that we must find in the work of art the very impress of our spirit with all its logic and its sensitiveness. The end is to create a world which shall be at once a world and ours. I think we can deduce thence all the fundamental conditions of a work of art; at all events we see how easily the experimental hypothesis at which we have arrived fits it.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_45_0	A point which it may be interesting to consider is the choice of the elements of a work of art. Springing from our spirit, it will discover the properties and the extraordinary mixtures which characterise it. It is a quality of our sensibility and our intelligence, to which attention has already been called, that nothing which affects them can remain isolated, and that these fusions — I might almost say symbioses — which are brought about between our impressions, of whatever order they may be, sensual or emotive, result in the birth of indefinable intellectual elements. And this to such a degree that it is really impossible to have what we can call a pure sensation, and that there are mixed for instance with the simplest vision, such as that of a banal object, memories and emotions that we generally do not analyse, but which give its originality to our impression. This quality is probably one of the most fertile resources of art. ‘The forms and sounds which it offers are, whether we will or no, impregnated with emotions of which we only have a global sensation, but which account in great part for its richness. The artist who creates can really employ at will and put side by side in his work, without its appearing strange to us, impressions which are quite dissimilar in their nature. The work thus created, absolutely incomprehensible for the intellect, since it is like an addition of disparate objects, is none the less familiar
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_45_1	to our spirit which accomplishes every moment this absurd operation.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_46_0	It is in this direction, I think, that one must seek for the solution of the problem of the subject in art which has so preoccupied people’s minds. Must we, or must we not, consider the subject of a work of art?’ The mistake is to suppose that there is a subject and a work which represents it. There is
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_47_0	57
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_48_0	THE NATURE OF BEAUTY IN
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_49_0	no. subject, there are only objects which may have served as models and which are part of the great reservoir whence the artist draws the elements of his work, and there is beside, independent, real and different, this work itself. By this absurd division of the work of art which is on the contrary essentially one, people have got into the habit of ranging on one side in the subject all the emotive elements of the work, and on the other in the thing executed all the formal elements; but this arrangement does not in any way correspond with our sensation any more than it does with that of the artist. ‘The latter—the man who would be a god—has built with the stones which he thought best. These may be merely forms or merely sounds: contrary to the outworn but persistent opinion that the subject is the essence of the work, his creation will be no less beautiful for that. But why should the artist, by an inverse reaction, systematically abstain from employing the regrets, the joys, and so many other nameless conceptions of our spirit? He has not, moreover, really abstained, and if one wishes to make experimental aesthetics one cannot thus, a priort, separate from works such as Beethoven’s — which by themselves form perhaps the most complex world that a man has ever conceived, and which is not a transcription of his joys and sorrows taken as subject, but a totality in which joys and sorrows contribute
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_49_1	their share to the general harmony. It suffices us that this totality possesses on the one hand a richness which makes it equal to the creations of nature, and on the other spiritual qualities which give it beauty.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_50_0	There, I think, we have in brief the generalities which form the philosophic prolongation of this essay. I hope that they may have made it clearer and given it a wider horizon, although they are probably false and certainly full of mystery. Aesthetic is not nearing completion. But whatever one thinks of these suggestions, the hypothesis of a necessary complexity remains: it too is perishable, no doubt, but, born of experience it can only be killed by experience; and that is the only nobility to which a hypothesis can decently lay claim.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_51_0	BEAUTY IN LITERATURE
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_52_0	There is no sentiment more ill-defined than that which we have with regard to the nature of Literary Beauty. We should have a certain shame in praising in a painter’s work “‘the freshness of the imagination which directs his choice of subject,”’ or the “tender feeling with which he details a grandmother’s wrinkled face’’; it is not, perhaps, because we have a clearer sense of plastic beauty than our elders, but, with a more exact understanding of the painter’s purpose, a shame has come to life in us which fears to praise for the wrong reason. It is science and not want of precision which creates delicacy. One might search in vain for this shame in our literary critiques; one writer is praised for his psychological penetration, another for the elegance of his phrases or the solid construction of his intrigues; one is amusing, another profound, and a third is praised for having created popular rhythms, or for having avoided adjectival excess — indifferently. The worst of it is that we feel all these things; the confusion is not in the mind of the critics, but in our own sensibility. Only an uneasiness arises from this want of definition, a malaise, an irritation in face of this heap of literary facts which lacks all classification. Only the facts exist, but the facts are terrible; they crush the spirit by their individuality. We admit them all: we adore the classics and secretly cherish the romantics; we insist on order and construction,
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_52_1	and it is enough for Laforgue to appear with his “little sensation” of orphans out for a Sunday walk, and of the piano heard at the corner of a desolate street, to make us forget our exigencies and make us proclaim the eternal superiority of living novelty over dead logic. Where then is literary beauty? Is there ever any special sentiment to which we can give that name?
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_53_0	Not only are we unable to define that which is so dear to us, but we do not even know in which direction to look for it. We see its reflection everywhere, nowhere the flame itself.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_54_0	I wish to propose here simply a method of research. It is identical with that which, in the sciences, gives us the brightest lights and perhaps the greatest spiritual pleasures: the comparison of formule. We find, for instance, that the movement of a pendulum or of a diapason are expressed by the same equation as the electrical oscillations of an emission station of Hertzian waves: from this apposition a sudden illumination emerges: quantities hitherto mysterious now reveal their meaning. Self-induction, which was supposed to be an original force, shows the true visage, long since known, of inertia. The heap of facts suddenly becomes orderly and manageable.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_55_0	Who knows if such comparisons might not give interesting results in aesthetics? It is no longer, naturally, a question of formule, but of analogous quantities or rather analogous realities. It is an intellectual experiment to be undertaken with prudence. The only underlying hypothesis necessary is that there exists a certain unity among all the arts or rather among our sensations of beauty, and this, I think, may easily be admitted.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_56_0	From the point of view of aesthetic theory, the plastic arts are the best known to us. It is not, indeed, that we know much even of them: we can affirm that a piece of architecture is beautiful, we cannot yet explain why, even in the simplest cases. At least we can say wherein its beauty consists: it is in its volume. Our reactions before a work of art are so complicated that we must consider it an important result to be able to isolate from them the specific aesthetic emotion. In a picture, colour is added to the volume, as also the play of light and certain movements which do not define precise forms, but which may play around the principal theme, echoing and enriching it. But still there are cases where the volume alone is sufficient to arouse the sentiment of beauty, and yolume remains always a fundamental element of it. What analogue in literature shall we give to volume? It suffices to transfer it from the domain of space to that of the spirit; and as the notion of volume admits of all spatial possibilities, the corresponding literary notion ought to admit of all spiritual possibilities. The psychological reality, the psychological complex—there is the material which the writer should work upon. Notice that in both domains our zesthetic sensibility rejects realities that are too simple, geometric volumes in one and pure ideas in the other. In spatial world there remains the vast crowd of complex volumes: in
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_56_1	the spiritual there remain the everyday realities of our soul, all the forms of our inner life.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_57_0	“As the painter creates a spatial being, the writer creates a psychological being.” Such, I think, is the hypothesis that we might admit as the basis of all literary criticism. We must before developing it obviate certain immediate objections:
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_58_0	1. Most people think that the painter has the intention of representing some object on his canvas, of copying the reality which he has before his eyes. The notion of the descriptive writer is no less popular even among writers themselves. Literature abounds in examples of minute descriptions, composed with a scientific respect for the observation of reality: landscapes, manners, characters are offered as ’true' All the literary schools have attributed value to this imitation of nature. On the other hand, all the same, they have safeguarded the rights of fiction, glorifying it even, under the names of phantasy, imagination, the power of creating “types,” etc.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_59_0	This indecision about the true role of the writer has resulted in a series of rules like the poetic art of Boileau and the prefaces of the Romantics — rules which each generation establishes or questions and which, however excellent they may be in themselves, are certainly all incapable of founding a general aesthetic of literature. We must decide now, frankly, as has been done in the domain of the plastic arts, whether the work is an independent creation—a reality, as undeniable as a tree or a man—or whether it is a document which is more or less trustworthy, in the same category as a geographer’s description or a psychologist’s observation. It is a mistake to suppose that one can unite the two conceptions; one can mix them, no doubt, and that is what is constantly done. There will come a time, I hope, when the pretension of a writer to contribute to psychology and even physiology (as Zola in the Rougon Macquart series) will appear as ridiculous as a pretension on the part of a landscape painter to contribute to geology or botany.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_60_0	The study of an existent reality and the creation of a new one ought not to be confounded. It is possible, it is certain even, that creation is favoured by study, and this is enough to explain all the precepts which teach the respect of “nature.” But we must be careful not to regard as an end what is only a means. A novel ought to be living but not impartial nor exact; it is not a source of information. I am almost ashamed to write all this; but do we not constantly hear novelists propose “‘to paint modern society” or the “‘manners of Paris,” to ‘“‘dissect the human heart” or to “bring to life” a past epoch? Has not a writer been recently taken to task for errors of date and “‘false”’ interpretation of the facts? Have they not praised Proust as a great psychologist, whereas he is in reality a great poet? The assimilation here suggested of literature to the plastic arts, and the idea that the writer’s end is solely to model a spiritual volume, would relegate sternly to the background the documentary value of a work of literature.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_61_0	2. A conception the very opposite of that which would make of the artist a describer, a man in the laboratory, is that which presents him solely as a man of his craft. ‘‘The subject is nothing,” so it runs—what matters is the manner in which it is treated, it is the form, it is the rhythm and harmony, the purity of the language, the wealth of vocabulary, etc. We must be on our guard here: the old scholastic distinction of form and content has created many confusions from which it is hard to get free.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_62_0	Let us eliminate first of all the subject. It is true that a writer can, like a painter, create a masterpiece by taking any sort of object as his point of departure. This exterior subject, I would rather say this pretext, has so little importance that it would be best to decide not to talk of it at all. The problem, then, stands thus: When Proust makes a still-life of some asparagus lying on a table, the subject is doubtless insignificant and without interest. Is the sentiment of beauty which we feel, given by the words, by their sound, by their rhythm, by the balance of the phrases, by their grammatical correctness — or do we owe it to the pleasing and delicate imaginations which this spectacle has suggested to the author? I avoid using the vague words “‘form” and “content” in order to fix our consideration on actual sensations. I think the reply is clear: It is the sense of the phrases that gives us pleasure and not their rhythm, it is our spirit and not our ear that Savours them. The work of art in question is a moment of the spirit of Proust—and, by the medium of words, a4 moment of our own spirit. The great danger in aesthetics is that of failing to take one’s position on the appropriate ground, of not seeing the reality of things. The aesthetic reality of a cathedral lies not in its mysticism, but in its form, its actual palpable form.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_62_1	The reality of a poem is in the spiritual shape that it offers us.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_63_0	I do not, however, deny that there is another pleasure in savouring the euphony of the phrase in a verse like:
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_64_0	“La fille de Minos et de Pasiphaé ”
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_65_0	which was dear to Bloch. But I say that it is very feeble when reduced to isolation, as one can discover by listening to a poem recited in an unknown language. ‘The check to certain postsymbolist attempts shows clearly that we are not near to accepting an art of words deprived of sense. Or rather we can accept it here and there, in fragments and by the way. Literary art none the less remains essentially an art of the spirit.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_66_0	Let us return to our hypothesis: the end of all literature is the creation of psychological beings as that of the plastic arts is the creation of spatial beings. One sees that it resumes all the preceding discussion. We must now proceed to make clear what may be the nature of these monsters born of our brains. Here, in all humility, is offered a sketch for a classification of the pure types, of which the majority of works of literary art are complexes.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_67_0	(a) The simplest entities that literary art admits are states of mind, or perhaps one ought to say moments of the spirit. They are what we are at a given moment: the landscape that we contemplate, the sentiment which agitates us, the wonderful rhythm of a respiration, the movement of a palm tree. The external reality blends with the interior, or rather there is only one reality. Those divisions, useful enough for the life of action into external objects, sensation, and sentiment, are abolished. It is the central principle of all lyric poetry. I must here call attention to what is more than a mere shade of meaning: a state of mind is not necessarily a sentimental state; and I do not mean that the lyric poet must confide his joys and sorrows to the reader. The aesthetic emotion is no more in poetry than elsewhere a sharing of pity or joy: it is an impassioned adoration before a. new birth, the happy surprise of an annunciation, gratitude on the threshold of a world revealed. Before reading a poem on the sadness of death, we know that sadness, and no words can avail in comparison with a direct experience. But sadness is only the pretext, the poem is not sadness; it is something different; a new direct experience of the spirit (not of the ear); an unforeseen mixture of sensations, ideas, memories, and emotions which find themselves miraculously in unison, and compose, one knows not how, a single whole. This
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_67_1	choice and this situation of common psychological values (as the painter does spatial value), herein lies the poet’s art. Mallarmé banished from it the dream; we must also keep out of it any idea of the transcription of a sentiment. As regards the new reality which the poem profers, we are just as far off if we explain it as being a matter of sadness or joy as if we explain it as a matter of cesuras. To Gnd it we must let the words themselves fall one by one into the mind, listen long, be sincere and not believe too surely that one will understand, even if it should be Ronsard, for instance, rather than Verlaine.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_68_0	(b) After the “state of mind” the simplest psychological entity is the character. It is the class of creation dear to the classics, perhaps because it has the strongest unity which is materially imposed on us in the person of the actor. It is upon it, too, that critics have bent most constantly the mania and the fury of their explanations: Hermione represents jealousy; Phedra, the passion of love; L’Avare, avarice, and the Mentor, lying—it is very simple. It was thus that in the eighteenth century they arrived at “creating” (?) the “Father of the family,” the “Son of the family,” etc., etc. Voltaire complained that the grand réles had all been played. He had nothing left but the scraps. It is easy, however, to perceive that those figures have more vitality in proportion as they are less representative. What does the Misanthrope represent? What does Hamlet? What, for that matter, does a cathedral? Nothing. They are monsters; these in the realm of the spirit; that in the realm of space.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_69_0	(c) The relations between the facts are psychological realities by the same right as the facts themselves. Our fathers called them simply situations, They have a life independent of the ‘characters, although there is a reciprocal modifying influence between them. ‘There are even some so powerful that they crush the personages and reduce them to one level. The history of CEdipus is such. The individuals in that situation are, as on a chess-board, pieces which count by reason of their relative situations. The game is begun: the monster lives, and the events are like its attitudes or the aspects of its visage.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_70_0	Moments of the spirit, characters, situations, and their complexes—these, it seems to me, all literature envisages. Let me now come back to the question of content and form, treated rather lightly in my haste to prove that the essential, the equivalent of volume in the plastic arts, is the content, the sense of the words the psychological reality which they define. One may refuse to place the aesthetic value of a poem solely in the euphony and rhythm of the verse (a proceeding which leads to painful deceptions) and all the same attribute more importance than I did just now to the “formal” elements: correctness of language, verbal richness, vivacity or amplitude of the phrase, elegance and ease of style, the general disposition of the work, etc. It needs certainly an effort to pass from the work as conceived to the work as written, and it is this effort that one would be tempted to call literary in the proper sense.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_71_0	A little reflection shows, however, that the elaboration and the work must be continuous. That is clear for , picture or a statue: from the sketch to the last detail it is always the same volume that the artist accumulates and models. Surely it is no otherwise with the writer. To a delicate perception that which is called form derives clearly from what is called content: it is not indifferent to the sense of a phrase whether it be correct or not: grammatical subtleties are often nothing but shades of the thought, the movement of the phrase being imposed by the movement of the mind, the choice of words by its nourishment and its form. The fact that the construction of the work has been placed among the formal elements is significant; it shows clearly where the error lies, the confusion between the “content” of the work and its “subject,” and the idea that the form is like a movable and inter-changeable frame. What is more essential, more fundamental in a man than his skeleton, in a work than its construction? Every reality, of whatever order it is, has always a scaffolding. It will be made of syllogisms if it is a question of geometry, of beams if it is a question of architecture. If we allow that a poem is a reality it must have a framework and of the same order as itself, which is more or less apparent but in any case perceptible. One sees the vanity
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_71_1	of this distinction between content andform. The formal elements under analysis show either as modellings or as essential framework. There is nothing to justify grouping them apart.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_72_0	In fact, then, only one distinction stands out: it is that which separates the thought and the written text. For it too often happens that the thought is vague and lacks force; a portion of the volume is then missing, and the text appears made of empty words, of words that have not their full sense, ordered not according to an imperious inner logic but according to custom, common usage, reminiscences. It is curious that one finds the analogue of this in the plastic arts.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_73_0	We have made the thought the equivalent of the volume; we must now take the written text as equivalent to the surface which delimits the volume. This comparison, strange enough at first sight, takes, on reflection, so unexpected a meaning that it is worth while, I think, to examine it. I pass over the amusing detail that surface and text are both skins through which we make contact with the reality they cover. Far more important is the explanation that one can give of the feeling of greater or less “‘density”’ that we experience before a work of art. That sense of density which we get from a monument depends to a great extent upon the way its surfaces have been treated. The ornaments upon it may have a plastic value, and function as a modelling of the total volume which thus attains its plenitude. But, on the other hand, they may be stuck on to the volume without aesthetic relation with it, and then the surface appears like a wrinkled skin, as though the idea of the work, the internal impulse which created the forms, had not had force enough to distend them and impose its proper curvature.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_74_0	Similar phenomena occur in literature. One of the beauties of classic works is precisely this tension of the text: each word in it has a sense so full and so evidently in touch with the rest of the discourse that the whole becomes a solid block. It is what is ordinarily praised under the name of sobriety. But that idea is false, for sobriety is not a virtue in itself. There are geniuses so potent that they can fill the wildest ornamentations. Shakespeare is not sober. The comparisons — volume-thought, surface-text — give a much larger explanation of the facts: distinct for a bad work, they become fused in a perfect one. All the artist’s efforts should tend towards this fusion. It alone, however, does not suffice to make a beautiful work, otherwise a cube or a theorem would be beautiful. It may even be the sign of poverty in the creative effort, due to an abuse of abstractions capable of exact statement. But for a complex work it is surely one of the elements of beauty.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_75_0	One might push the comparison further, and show that there exists a modelling of the text important by what it adds of complexity to forms too simple in themselves; one could indicate the existence of literary “depth,” and search out the methods which give us that illusion. But these are details in which one must guard against facile ingenuity.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_76_0	For my part I would draw from this parallel between plastic and literary art two conclusions. First, that it has allowed us a simple
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_77_0	and acceptable definition of literary art. We want to know, in effect, if a great writer is he who makes harmonious or correct or profound phrases or substantial images. We wish, above all, not to be told that the great writer unites all these disparate qualities, since we know that he may be incorrect like Saint Simon, or lack profundity as much as Hugo. ‘There is a literary emotion which we must disengage from the tangle of other emotions. The simple definition which I have — described declares that there are psychological unities, spiritual entities, and that the poem or the book ought to give us the impression that it has created one of these beings. (Naturally no mysticism is implied here.) My definition does not explain very much; for we ought to be able to tell why certain psychological complexes give us this sentiment of unity and independent life whilst others remain only mixtures —why Tartuffe exists and the hero of a bad novel does not. But this is a general problem that one can pose also with regard to the volumes of the plastic arts and about musical phrases. It is already something gained to be able to put the question and to know in what direction to look further.
2-6-nature-beauty	doc_16_78_0	And certainly if such parallels as this had a recognised value in aesthetics our researches would become much easier. Experiments like cubism are full of indications which might have a general bearing. Music has been for long the purest art, the art of which the effects are apprehended by the purest feeling; painting and sculpture are to-day almost approaching this. But literature remains encumbered with accessories, philosophical, psychological, social demonstration, with sentimentalities and opinions. A great step would be made if we could savour, appreciate, and discuss pure literary qualities. I say a great step—and in this I am not thinking only of aesthetics which is a very small matter beside the realities it examines. I know how much any pleasure can be heightened by our attaining to a clear conscioysness of it, and I am simply thinking of the pleasures of reading. The game is well worth the risk of some poor comparisons.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_0_0	CATCHWORDS AND CLAPTRAP
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_1_0	These discursive and random comments are the indulgence of a private taste, which finds in language as used one of the most amusing subjects for meditation and speculation. This fantastical currency, minted by the requirements of human thought and feeling, circulated by the urgent desire we have to convey these somehow to our fellows, so precisely, so delicately wrought and cast into exact and minute forms, so skilfully adapted to the commerce which is its purpose, and, having been so shaped, shaping in its turn thought itself, stamping it ever freshly with intricate designs—except that nothing in this curious world can well be selected and labelled as odd, it might seem odd that such a currency should have been coined by our simian race.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_2_0	But what is not by any means odd is that, having contrived for each feeling, each thought, each fact, its appropriate symbol, beautifully neat and fit, so that we may enjoy ready commerce of ideas, we should proceed, in the perversity of our human nature, to confuse the coins together, using one where another should serve. We prefer, as often as not, to express what we mean in phraseology which means precisely something else. It is, possibly, a revolt against the dominance of established usage, a triumphant assertion that man is lord of language, not language of man, a surging up of the eggish pride Which said: “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean.” Is yet one more expression of the free spirit of man striving perpetually against a universe which seeks to enthral him — a triumphant gesture of anarchy. Yet, because prolonged anarchy is impossible to man’s law-bound nature, as to that of the universe which bore him, each attempt at it defeats itself, each new sense given to a word or phrase becomes stereotyped, becomes rapidly, not an individual, but a herd sense, the users giving countenance and encouragement one to the other. What the coins originally stood for we forget; we fling them loosely about, sometimes with misapprehension or deliberate misapplication, sometimes merely with a vague feeling that here are words, let them somehow convey our meaning. The psychology behind the various misuses is an interesting study.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_3_0	Many words, many phrases, seem to acquire nimbuses of association, which do rough service for exact Meaning, Such a word is nameless, which comes to some minds haloed with terror. “Avenging,” cries Shelley, carried away by his distaste for fathers, “such a nameless wrong, as turns black parricide to piety.” He did not mean that the wrong to which he referred had no name; it was, in fact, named incest; he merely meant that the word came into his head with a sinister aura of horror about it that made it seem apt to the case, as it had seemed apt to the writer of the Book of Wisdom to say: “Worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end of all evil.” All those who write of nameless horrors, nameless vices, nameless orgies, know, when they reflect, that none of these things need actually be nameless to those with clear heads and good dictionaries; what they mean is horrid, only they prefer a vaguer, less definite, and therefore more terrible adjective. Such another word is nominal, which comes so readily to the help of the business man. “A nominal sum,” he will say. Does he mean that, though he calls it a sum, there will in point of fact be no sum to be paid? He does not. Rather, in fact, the contrary. What he does mean is ‘‘very small.” Why, then, does he not say so? There seems no reason but that
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_3_1	“‘nominal” is the inexact rather than the exact word, and therefore sounds smaller, just as ““nameless” sounds more dreadful. So with all those words on which pedagogic comment has grown hackneyed—dectmated, or annihilated, for “greatly reduced in numbers,” phenomenal for extraordinary, and all the like mathematical or philosophic expressions so often inaccurately applied; and, of course, the stock misuse of literally where “metaphorically”? is meant, which is not so much inexact as directly opposed to the meaning it strives to convey, and is an excellent example of man’s deliberate revolt against the rigidity of language. So, in the same way, is a curious use of the word precedent which I came on lately in an evening paper: “The event is tegarded as a precedent, and is not likely ever to be repeated.” The journalist probably meant “a unique occurrence,” and again has provided a good instance of linguistic Oppositionism.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_4_0	But the inaccurate use of single words can be left to the care of etymologists and lexicographers, who are ever busy in the matter. What has been less investigated is the vague and thetorical use of phrases and ideas which Carry with them certain associations in the mind of the user, and which will, he trusts, carry across similar associations to the hearer or reader. The psychologically interesting thing is the belief that these associations, these meanings in the user’s mind, will be more effectively transmitted by a vague phrase than by a precise and accurate one. Sometimes, of course, the inaccuracy arises from a desire to convey not a correct but an incorrect fact, even when the truth is known to be known to the person addressed, so that there is no question of deceit; as when a Frenchman recently exclaimed to an Englishman: “The franc in English money is only worth a sou.” One cannot believe that this was the outcome of a belief that the exchange stood at 480 francs to the pound on a day when it actually stood at 170, nor, scarcely, that he hoped to make the Englishman believe it. His statement more likely arose from a feeling that a sou is a small coin, and that he was saying, “The franc is worth scarcely anything at all.” Why, then, instead of saying this, did he select a particular and incorrect sum of money? Why did he not say three sous, which would have
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_4_1	been approximately correct? The answer in this case is simple: he desired to exaggerate. And here we have what may be called a primary human need, which should be placed by psychologists with the desire for nourishment, for safety, for sense - gratifications, and for appreciation, as one of the elemental lusts of man. Infants exaggerate: they are, indeed, the world’s greatest exaggerators. Before they ca? speak they seek to magnify their woes with louder cries than the situation in Which they find themselves placed, lamentable though this usually is, warrants. They give to their grief rhetorical expression which does not accurately represent it. Feeling a slight discomfort, they exclaim, in the only phraseology as yet known to them, “‘T am in torment, in anguish, in hell. Amend my situation forthwith, or I perish.” A little later, when they can speak, they will apply the largest measures that they know to trifling distances or heights. ‘“‘Miles wide,” they will say of streams, or ‘miles high” of the elephant. They are using mile as the Frenchman used sou, merely as an extreme measure. They love the imagination of immensity; they revel in extremes. ‘How small,” they inquire, with zest, “would be a quite new Esquimaux baby?” “Why?” responds the indifferent nurse. If the child understood this elliptical counterquestion (which he does not) and answered it truly, he would say: “Because I desire to hear of a human creature very, very tiny indeed. So he loves to be told of giants and
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_4_2	of dwarfs, to behold elephants, to inquire “How high is the largest mountain in the world?” He is a natural extremist.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_5_0	Nevertheless, the child’s pure and rational sense of logic, outgrown all too soon, keeps him from some of the : deliberate excesses of adult life, prevents him even from understanding them. They are to him a stumbling-block. “I shan’t be gone more than a minute,”’ Says the elder. The child, waiting, perceiving that far more than sixty seconds has elapsed, puts down the adult, probably not for the first time, as a liar. He does not yet know that the word “minute” is a common coin, loosely thrown about, to symbolise “ a short time.” Though, as to _ that, the vague idea we have as to the actual lenpth of sixty seconds someumes induces a contrary procedure. An extraordinary number of novelists puzzled my literal childhood by making their people, engaged in conversation, pause a minute, sometimes even ‘“‘a full minute,” before replying to some remark—a thing seldom done in any ordinary duologue, and one which would quite break the conversational current. One suspects that the writer often means about ten seconds, which is actually quite a good pause, but, for some reason, sounds short. So he says minute, which he regards as an elastic term of time—far more so than hour, day, week, or month.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_6_0	To return to the desire for exaggeration. This seems to be an immensely important factor in the development of human language, conversation, and literature. It accounts, of course, for the spreading of many strange tales, travellers’ and others, for a large proportion of the inaccurate use of words, for a large number of misstatements and loose phraseology, and for a great deal of the daily press. “Exciting developments,” “amazing Scenes,» how rarely do these journalistic myths actually either excite or amaze. The favourite word sensational one can pass, for every occurrence in the sphere of sense is, of course, that; further, to hear of it doubtless causes some sensation, however mild. But one suspects the intention of being the same as in the other cases—i.e. to give an impression that something more exciting, important, or what not, has occurred than is actually the case: in short, to magnify. “A marvellous honest fellow,” we used to say a few hundred years back, meaning, merely, very honest: and, 4 century or two later, “a monstrous, OF an amazingly, agreeable man.” _ More lately, “an azfully nice person,” 2nd to-day “a frightfully, or extraordinarily, good sort.” Increasingly down the ages we have shirked the simple “very” as inadequate to its appointed task, and reserved it for mild cases. In order to convey a high degree of the quality on which we are commenting, we feel the need to imply some imaginary feeling of wonder, amaze, awe, or fear, which such an extremity of
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_6_1	quality might be supposed to conjure in our breasts.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_7_0	This tendency to magnify seems most prevalent and most acute when emotion is most strongly roused. It is at these times that the precise and accurate statement of fact seems most inadequate to the situation’s ardent demands, and we cannot endure to leave truth in her nakedness to speak for herself. When the situation is epidemic rather than individual, a phraseology of magnification comes into wide use, and is broadcast through the press or other
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_8_0	17 2 machinery available. This is noticeable during all wars, revolutions, and other general human troubles. A recent example of such a period in this country was the General Strike of May 1926, and, in a less degree, the ensuing months of the Coal Strike. During the General Strike, eloquence was to some extent fettered by certain restrictions on the press, which had small room for expansive comment, except the Labour press, which was at the time, and indeed often is, a highly interesting and instructive psychological study. The vocabulary of this press is a very profitable field of research for those interested in what may be called the language of emotion, as opposed to that of cold and precise statement. Very similar language may be heard from es Labour benches in the House of Commons during many debates; pedantic accuracy of speech is, indeed, scarcely to be looked for in any part of either House of Parliament, or in the governing assembly of any country; it would probably be unbecoming in a politician, who should rather cultivate the arts of rhetoric. But to the already sufficient imaginativeness of the politician and the journalist, the Labour members and the Labour journalists seem to add an element of sound and fary signifying nothing, which is highly interesting to observe and analyse. It derives partly, no doubt, from lack of precise scholastic training, of which one of the surest results is a nearer approach to exact speech, a closer fitting together of
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_8_1	word and fact, and partly from the strong emotion very naturally engendered by misfortune, by the perpetual oppression of circumstance, by association with, or meditation upon, those who have all the time to be swimming hard in order to keep above water, and even so often sink, The fact that millions of persons lead miserably hard and poor lives, without any of the amenities of a luxurious civilisation, while more fortunate beings spend on pleasures in a month what would keep a poor family for a year, and lavishly squander on personal luxury without apparent consciousness of any debt owed to the less lucky—the hot bitterness of this world-wide and worldold fact has perhaps so enflamed and melted the hearts and brains of many of the spokesmen of the poor that they literally cannot, do not know how to, speak in an accurate sense. They speak as men in a blind passion of pity and rage: furthermore, as men who have had no training in logic or in language, but must needs use the first weapon that comes to hand, be it apt or not. It is a pity, for they thereby often spoil a perfectly good case — and indeed their case, taking it by and large, and apart from detail, is the best case in the world — that of the have-nots against those who have and to spare. But nearly always they spoil it in statement by slip-shod cant and invective. In the darkened confusion of their
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_8_2	minds they cry “murder” when there is no question of any taking of life, meaning (one supposes) that here is something they think cruel and hard, that murder is cruel and hard, and that therefore this thing must be murder. It is an elementary fallacy, which a first course in logic would make impossible.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_9_0	And this leads to the question of words and their haloes. In such minds, excited, untrained, and confused, words seem to be rather symbols of some vague body of associations than the precise outward shapes of definite and clear-cut meanings; phrases rush into the mind haloed with pathos, tragedy, vice, or what not. Such a phrase, apparently, is women and children. In A Passage to India, Mr E. M. Forster relates the way in which the members of the Anglo-Indian club worked themselves up into a frenzy of excitement and anger by repeating-—“‘the women and children.” And, indeed, these words, either severally or combined, do appear to have some curious hypnotic effect. They are called in, these unfortunate women and children (who always seem to be in evil case, threatened by danger, hardship, or sudden death), to do constant duty in emergencies. “Women and Babies Clubbed by Police,” ran a heading in a Labour paper during the recent strike. Such police recall less the placid policemen we see about than the brutal constabulary in Ouida’s novels, who, as they go about their business, casually brain passing puppies with their batons. “The women and children will be the first to suffer,”’ wrote the kindly persons who published in the press an appeal for help. for miners’ families. They cannot have believed what they said: they cannot, I think, have intended such a libel on the miner as seriously to mean that he would let his family want before himself. I am
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_9_1	sure, in fact, that they meant nothing so unjust or so untrue; they merely sought to strengthen (though they actually weakened) their appeal by the use of a little unconscious claptrap.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_10_0	"“ Brass-faced baby-killers,”? remarked Miss Ellen Wilkinson, M.P., alluding _ to the Government—lI forget the precise occasion of the phrase, and in what manner the Government had at the moment been massacring the innocents, but “baby-killer” was a phrase in great favour during the strike, as during the last European war. It has, indeed, at times been perilously near becoming merely a vague expression of distaste. For baby is another of these haloed words, bearing with it infinite associations of pathos and persecuted innocency. ""Tighten the binders"" was a pathetic slogan of the strike. ""A holocaust has only been prevented by the sacrificial heroism of the mothers,"" said a newspaper; and mother, of course, is another charmed word."
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_11_0	"Why all this stress upon the sufferings of infants, in reality the section of the population most carefully provided for during any emergency? The answer is simple: a baby is a symbol of helpless innocence, and its name makes a good slogan. If a man making a speech to a simple audience should, gravelled for lack of matter, desire to gain time, all he need to do is to say, ""I appeal to you in the name of your little children,” or, “What about the kiddies? ” and he will have the less critical part of his audience cheering long enough to enable him to collect his thoughts and start afresh. So it was during the last European war, and, I dare say, during all the wars that have been. “Go and fight for the women and children” recruiting speeches would exclaim, and alluded with bitter invective to those of our foes who had deliberately selected British babies (or babes, which sounds still more moving) as the targets of their bombs. In point of fact, the number of British infants slain by enemy bombs during the war was extremely small, but one might have gathered from the press that they formed the majority of slain non-combatants. In our attacks on conduct we mislike, we wave the corpses of women and children about us like banners as we charge."
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_12_0	The reason for this use of babies is, obviously, their tender age, inferior physical and mental condition, and small size. Presumably the similar use of women, where it exists, is also based on their comparatively frail physique. But I do not profess to understand the full aura of associations, either comic or moving, which surround the name woman; it is said, indeed, and no doubt truly, that no woman can understand them. It is certain that this apparently simple and straightforward word has a considerable element of catchword about it, and has become surrounded by a good deal of claptrap.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_13_0	So, for that matter, has the word man. I have frequently observed the name denoting the male half of humanity to be curiously used, as if it carried with it some kind of association outside its strict meaning. “I said to myself,” the wife of a public man recently announced to the world, alluding to her husband, “I said to myself, he is a man.” She obviously was not merely announcing species and sex, but intended the word to carry to her audience qualities, presumably admirable, associated in her mind with the male adult creature. This, indeed, is a not uncommon piece of symbolism, and produces such remarks as “Quit you like men.” “And, what is more, you'll be a man, my son,” and so forth. (“What would he have turned into if he hadn’t been able to do all those things in the poem?” as children inquire.) Anyhow, we may take it (and very creditable it is to us that it should be so, after all these centuries) that the word man, like the word human, carries an aura of, on the whole, favourable associations, just as (and it is a bad mark to the other animal species that it is so) the names of most of our fellow-creatures on this globe, such as dog, hound, cur, swine, ape, cat, rat, sow, ass, peacock, and the rest (two notable exceptions are duck and lamb — both, it May be added, very good eating and requiring peas) carry such poor
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_13_1	associations that they have always had a considerable vogue as uncomplimentary epithets for human beings.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_14_0	Another haloed catchword, and this time the halo is of the purest gold, is the word cricket (denoting the game, not the insect), so that to play cricket, in the mouths of some persons, seems to mean to behave in a pure and noble manner. I have understood better how this synonym, which has always puzzled me, arose since I overheard this summer some remarks made to one another by the Australian and British cricket teams and broadcasted by the B.B.C. Allowing for a certain confusion of thought and language due to the fact that most of the speakers were probably more at home with bats and balls than with ideas, and that all had just lunched, it did emerge clearly that some of these devotees of the game believed, or said they believed, in some improving moral effect produced by it. One of them said: “Cricket is an antidote to Bolshevism and degeneracy.” The speaker did not explain, nor did others present inquire, in what precise manner this game affects the political opinions of its players, nor how many wickets it takes to turn a Bolshevist cricketer into a Fascist. As to degeneracy, it is not clear whether physical or moral degeneracy was meant. If physical, one imagines that a harder and more active game might be even more effective. If Mental, would not a game that left degenerates less time on their hands for their own devices be better? One might, surely, go quite far in the process
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_14_1	of deterioration while One’s side was in. But still, whether or not the supporters of this moral-improvement theory are able to explain it satisfactorily to others, it is apparent that it is held, and it has very likely led to the curious transference of the word cricket to the sphere of moral behaviour, The other possible explanation, the analogy of good play and good conduct, seems less tenable, for why, among all the games which can be well played, Should cricket be selected? Anyhow, one observes that the persons who believe the game to be morally improving are usually the same as those who use the phrase, which looks as if theory and phrase were allied.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_15_0	As to Bolshevism, alluded to thus unfavourably by cricketers after lunch, it is a good example of a catchword bearing the more sinister type of halo. As used by some people, it seems to have lost any accurate connotation, and to imply less a Russian political system than a state of mind. It is, one gathers, a state of mind usually regarded as undesirable by those who use the word, _ though, if analysed even by these, it seems sometimes to resolve itself into a very natural desire for better conditions of work and wages. Oddly, too, it is often used to denote a supposed anarchic desire to rebel against law, order, and authority, which seems a queer transversal of meaning, when we consider that Bolshevism de facto is probably the severest, most rigorous, and authoritative form of governmental °ppression under which man has yet lived, and the furthest removed from either anarchy or liberty. Those who use the name in this sense are probably referring back to the time before Bolshevism was the established order, and when, therefore, it had for a period to take a revolutionary line. So liable are words to somersaults, that none seems stable in its firmament, and before long we may have “pacifist? flung about to brand one who is supposed to desire war. There seems no limit to these verbal acrobatics.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_16_0	Which is to say that, once you step outside precise dictionary values and depend on a nimbus of associations to carry your meaning across, you are on dangerous ground. For nimbuses are vague and tricky things, changing colour all the time, seen differently by different eyes, and the sense you try to convey by a catchword may suffer a change between your mind and your hearer’s. Say “Bolshevist,” meaning “one who desires to upset the existing order,” or “one who desires to acquire more wealth and wages,” to someone who sees Bolshevists as people who firmly uphold an established order and have concentrated wealth into a few governing hands, and you will miss your mark, It is safer, when you invoke the name of a foreign political party, to use it strictly for that foreign political party and for nothing else; just as it is safer, when you say “‘cricket,?? to mean merely a game played with bat, ball, and wickets. It is also safer, when we say “capitalist,” not to trust to it, as some do, to carry implications of greed, wickedness, and large incomes, for to what may be called dictionary minds it means merely a person who has invested such wealth as he has in some productive undertaking (such as a street taxi, a barrel-organ, a shop, or a dancing bear), instead of keeping it loose and : ready to spend. The dictionary mind, in its literal unimaginativeness, cannot understand why capitalism is a bad system, or
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_16_1	why capitalists are necessarily wealthy and probably wicked. In half the contexts in which “capitalist” (sometimes called in anger capzialist, as if a cat were spitting) is used as a term of opprobrium, what is meant is “a man richer than he should be,” and it is wiser to say this, even though it takes a little longer. I am told, by the way, that this question of taking longer, of space, is an important determining factor in newspaper phraseology, and particularly in the wording of headlines. It often substitutes for “married” the old-fashioned “wed,” and, doubtless, often, too, substitutes the wrong word for the right. But, in the main, such substitutions have some psychological basis, which is what makes them an interesting study.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_17_0	To get back to verbal haloes, these have always been particularly prevalent in the minds of poets and other writers. There is a type of poetic mind which relies instinctively on association, on the repetition of certain words and phrases, to achieve the effect desired, of beauty, desolation, terror, or what not. The verse of the late nineteenth and quite early twentieth centuries, for example, abounds in such words as purple, pale, dim, strange-coloured, opaline, crystalline, chrysoprase, shimmeting, glimmering, shadowy, grey, blind, swooning, orchard, honey-coloured moon, repeated again and again like an incantation, as Homer repeated wine-dark sea, of a sea not actually very like wine (the Greeks nearly all loved tags), as Miss Edith Sitwell applies, even when least deserved, such epithets as “creaking,” and as the eighteenth-century poets called on nymphs, verdant lawns, enchanting groves, embower’d towers, and the like features of a neat and parklike landscape, to convey the aroma of poetry. Such catchwords have always been used rather vaguely and voluptuously, so that the “purple”? and “shadowy” of the late Victorians both symbolised more a spiritual atmosphere than, respectively, a definite colour and a definite arrangement of light and shade. The intention of such repetitions is rather to hypnotise than to be precisely apt. “A chain of roses threaded on a wire and pressed one against the other” (to quote M. Jean Cocteau on the style of Barrés) — this was the kind of effect aimed at by many of the late Victorian poets. To-day it
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_17_1	is less often roses that are so threaded than harder, pricklier, less sweetlyscented objects. The poets of to-day do not escape this pitfall of catchwords, but the catchwords are different, as they are in every age. And, on the whole, they are fewer than at many periods of verse-making. A closer exactitude and realism informs much of the verse of to-day; we have, of course, those elegant, fantastic, and romantic anti-realists, the Sitwells and their imitators, but many poets seem to be inspired with a desire to impart precise and detailed information as to the form and colour of the objects they have observed. Phrase-making is not, for the moment, so much in fashion as usual. Verlaine, Mallarmé, and Rimbaud are dead, the symbolists have perished on the air, and the days seem far distant when Belgians roamed in conservatories under freezing moons. Most of the better writers of verse and prose, in all countries, seek more or less after precision, and have gained in truth what they have perhaps lost in loveliness. Claptrap, facile and inaccurate symbolism, the repetition of the tag and the slogan, are to be found mainly just now in third-rate literature, in popular speech, and in the less educated press. In these places one finds, on a lower plane, the same intention — the lazy and sentimental desire to convey an effect by using catchwords.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_18_0	Allied with this desire is an impulse ever busily at work on the English language, the instinct of prudery, of evasion of some fact or object the mention of which may possibly shock someone. Among the more obvious and vulgar of the inaccurate substitutions which derive from this instinct is the curious use, noticeable in newspapers and in courts of law, of the imbecile phrase “in a certain condition” for “going to have a child,” and the lately prevalent and particularly fatuous “intimate.” The fact that, apparently, everyone concerned panders to and connives at this vulgar genteelism on the part of learned counsels and others, and answers them according to their folly, instead of replying, “Everyone is always in a certain condition,” or “Do you mean, were we lovers?” is evidence either of the cynical and patient toleration with which we regard the vagaries of the law, or of the wide existence of that deeply rooted prudery for which Britons are famed in Europe.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_19_0	The instinct for evasion accounts, probably, for more than these obvious inanities. Many a strange phrase strays about third-rate fiction to puzzle literalminded readers. There is, for example, a remark often made, be wiped his glasses. This means that he felt emotion, and the implication is that the moisture which rose to the eyes in consequence of the emotion had settled on and dimmed the glasses. But l am informed by those who wear glasses that this is not what actually occurs, and that, when tears gather in the eyes, they do not spray out horizontally So as to wet the glasses, but either remain in the eyes unfallen until teabsorbed, or roll vertically down the cheeks; nor do they give out steam or mist; therefore this process of wiping the glasses is not called for more at lachrymose moments than at others. If this is, as seems probable enough, the case, then either those who use this phrase do not know it, or, knowing, they ignore it, and deliberately use the words he wiped his glasses as a convenient (because indirect) way of Saying “tears were in his eyes.” The impulse to do this is probably mixed; partly it is the instinct for evasion, a belief that masculine tears are not the thing (for it is usually male beings, such as colonels, doctors, lawyers, financiers, and the like stern men of affairs, who resort to this superfluous wiping process) and partly a desire to be faintly arch, to imply
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_19_1	rather than to state, as in “There was something suspiciously like the sound of a kiss,” and similar facetie (I use this word, of course, in its literal, not in its euphemistic booksellers’ sense). Another common evasion of the fact of tears is a narration of how the nose was blown, but this, unlike the other, is a legitimate symbol.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_20_0	"Closely allied to the instinct for prudish evasion, and also hard at work, is the tendency to see evil where no evil is. There are scores of words harmless in etymology and original meaning which are, to quote a frequent dictionary comment, “now used in a bad sense.” Take conspiracy, for instance, and conspire. Dr Johnson, who confined himself for the most part to Meanings current and accepted at the time when he wrote, explains conspiracy as “‘a private agreement among several persons to commit some crime; a plot; a concerted treason, an agreement of men to always taken in the evil part."" The Oxford Dictionary, more historical in aim and scope, yet can, apparently, find in history no instance of men conspiring for good objects, and so we must assume that, from very earl days, those who put their heads close and breathed together have been suspected of planning some evil."
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_21_0	Out of the many other harmless and neutral words thus degraded by the mind of man, spinster may be selected as a pathetic example. From meaning first a woman who spins, one of Shakespeare’s “spinsters and knitters in the sun,” then merely an unmarried girl or Woman, it seems to have acquired (outside its legal use) some opprobrious cant sense, and to be used often with reference to some regrettable qualities, or to advanced age, or both. There a tendency not to use it of unmarried gitls; a tendency even not to use it of unmarried older women unless they fall, in the opinion of the speaker, into a certain temperamental category. Bachelor seems to have escaped, so far, similar opprobrious associations, so much so that the absurd and paradoxical phrase bachelor woman, or bachelor girl, has been coined to denote an unmarried female whom it would seem inapt, and pethaps harsh, to call a spinster. This impulse to degrade has produced so Many cant uses of words and phrases that it must be counted one of the formative instincts in the language.
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_22_0	So, then, we have all these various psychological factors, and, doubtless, many more at which we might easily arrive by further thought, working side by side, towards the same ends of dark confusion. The human desire to magnify; the human instinct of evasion; the more obscure human preference for conveying meaning tactically, by a halo of vague associations, rather than by a precise statement; the desire to convey atmosphere by the hypnotism of phrases; the tendency to think evil; and ordinary unlettered human ignorance. And beyond all these, there is the heady human arrogance which makes us determine that words shall be our servants, not our masters, and causes us to dig as wide a gulf as may be between the meanings given them by our ancestors and those we have decided that they shall bear. After all, if you come to that, who were our ancestors that they should have the ordering of our speech? What they did (which was to set accepted meanings continually at defiance) we will in our turn do. Do dictionaries say that a word bears one meaning? We will cause it to bear another. It is, after all, our creature. Language should do anything it is told, undertake any job required, not be a stubborn, one-idead thing, like a household of servants who will each perform only his appointed
2-4-catchwords-claptrap	doc_17_23_0	task. To make each word a maid-of-all-work—here is a task worthy of our endeavours. But the convenience of such a result is a little counterbalanced by the inconvenience of having to expend a good deal of imagination and intuition on guessing at the particular work which has been assigned to any given word at the moment. The fate of language will, perhaps, ultimately depend largely on what proportion of its users object more to taking this trouble than to the rigidity of specialised service. Meanwhile, we have plenty of material for interesting speculation.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_0_0	ART AND COMMERCE
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_1_0	Life cannot be carried on without some science even if it is only that instinctive science which animals possess. But it can perfectly well be carried on without art. It is really very surprising, therefore, to note that, however near men may at times have come to such a condition, they have never, I believe, continued to exist without art of some kind. It must therefore correspond to some fundamental conformation of man’s nature.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_2_0	Let us consider the life of man from this point of view and find out why, wherefore, and when he demands the assistance of this apparently non-essential activity. He can be born without the aid of art, but if he is born into a Christian community his godparents are likely to employ a silversmith on his behalf. He can be fed without the aid of art (it would be wrong here to talk of the art of cooking since the word art is here used in another sense. The word craft would be more appropriate). He can be clothed without art — but he has hardly ever consented to restrict himself to the merely needful in clothing. Personal vanity at once makes appeal to some kind of an artist — an embroiderer or a jeweller. He can be sheltered without art — but again he is not content merely to be sheltered ; again he wishes to express to the outside world that sense of his own importance of which he has continually to remind other people. Therefore he calls in an artist to make his house more magnificent, more attractive to the eye than the mere satisfaction of the need for shelter would imply.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_3_0	Then he belongs to some herd or other, some tribe or nation, and this herd will also have its collective vanity and sense of importance which again will find expression through works of art — commemorative statues, public buildings, and so forth. Our typical character, if he lives in a complicated and ancient civilisation like ours, and if he occupies a fairly high position, will become symbolic to some group or another, whether as father of the family, or head of a business, or president of a club; and in all these situations the desire to eternalise his personality will lead to his again calling in an artist to paint or sculpt his portrait. Finally, he dies — and though he can accomplish this act and can even get buried without the artist’s help — either he or his family will be likely to call in another artist to commemorate his virtues in a funeral monument. In fact, from the cradle to the grave our typical man, even supposing he himself has not the particular sensitiveness to beauty which incites people to care about works of art, will buy and help buy in the course of his life a good many works of art.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_4_0	Now in all this account I have talked about artists and works of art as though we all knew exactly what we meant by these words. I have used the words in what one may call their official sense—the sense in which for purposes of income-tax Sir Edwin Landseer; Mr Frith; Mr X., R.A.; Mr Y., R.A.; and Mr Z., R.A., for I do not wish to be personal, sign their declarations as “ artists ”—the sense in which the Albert and Edith Cavell Memorials are described as “ works of art.” But we all know that between the persons I have named and certain other gentlemen, also called artists, such as Giotto, Giorgione, Poussin, Daumier, there is so great a difference of degree that we may be excused for regarding them as distinct kinds. We all know that the Edith Cavell sculpture is not at all the same kind of thing as the Medici tombs or the Gattamelata statue. But we have no words to express these distinctions though we know them to be real. And, indeed, I find myself continually held up by the want of convenient symbols for these ideas.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_5_0	For the purposes of this essay the need of proper symbols becomes so pressing that I find myself forced to invent them. We have a word, “ artifact” for any object made by man as opposed to objects of natural formation, but we have no word for any object made by man for other purposes than the necessities of life, nor have we a word for the class of men who make such objects. For want of any better words I propose here to adapt from the Latin “ opifex ” the words “ opificer” and “‘ opifact.” An opifact, then, is any object made by man not for direct use but for the gratification of those special feelings and desires, those various forms of ostentation of which I spoke. All such objects I will—for this occasion—call opifacts, and I will use the word opificer for those who make them. I will then pick from the classes of opifacts those objects in which we can trace a quite particular quality, the quality of expressing a particular emotion which we call the aesthetic emotion, and I will call those objects, works of art. And I will pick out from the large class of opificers those workmen who having this emotion very strongly seek to express it in their work, and I will call them artists. Now what I want to make plain is that, whilst human beings are so constituted that they always require a great many opificers to produce a
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_5_1	great variety of opifacts, society can get along quite comfortably, and for an indefinitely long time, without the existence of artists or works of art, in the special sense which I now give to these words.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_6_0	Our brief analysis of those occasions and situations in the life of our private citizen, when he calls in opificers and orders opifacts, showed that the impulse to these actions was generally that of the exaltation in one way or another of his personal worth either in his own or still more in others’ eyes. Veblen’s remarkable book on the Theory of the Leisured Class throws a great deal of light on this procedure. According to him, the warrior caste in any primitive society had a right to the biggest spoils of successful warfare. A man was known as a member of that caste by the trophies he was able to display on his own person and the persons of his womenkind and dependents. Modern societies have not altogether forgotten these facts, and, consequently, the gentleman is known by the hints—sometimes blatant, sometimes subtle —which he throws out to all the world that he possesses spoils and is one of our conquering class. Opifacts of all kinds, from the gold bangles on the negro chieftain’s wife to the splendid liveries of a lord’s footmen, are the readiest means to make the situation plain. And the rarer and more expensive they are the better they answer their purpose. In fact, the opifact is primarily an advertisement.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_7_0	Societies of all kinds no less than individuals have recognised this fact. They behave, indeed, almost exactly like individuals in this respect. Big banking firms encase their offices in marble, and load their doors with chased bronze; town councils expand the facades of their town-halls, and have frescoes advertising the glory of the town’s history painted on their walls; nations flaunt their Law Courts and pile up expensive national memorials in their capitals; and when kings stood for the ‘nation, they advertised in innumerable ways the pre-eminence of their persons and the splendour of their reigns. Finally, all religious societies have appealed largely to the opificer to glorify their temples and increase the hypnotic effect of their ritual. It may seem incorrect to classify ritual as a branch of advertisement, but from our point of view they are at least closely allied. Both aim at creating by suggestion a heightened sense of worth and importance in the minds of the people. We see, in fact, that advertisement in one form or another has been one of the greatest of social forces throughout human history, and that it has almost always found in the opificer its best executant, and in the opifact its chief weapon of attack. And it is due to the genuine social need of advertisement that human societies have almost always produced opifacts.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_8_0	And since artists are a particular kind of opificer, and works of art are a kind of opifact, this great social system accounts for the fact that, incidentally, artists and works of art occur. If we could only tell exactly why, when, and wherefore these sports occur, we should know a great deal more about the history of the human spirit than we do. One fact is fairly apparent. The opificer is, as a rule, a fairly good member of society. He conforms without much difficulty. The artist is an intolerant individualist claiming a kind of divine right to the convictions of his peculiar sensibility. Consequently we may say that some margin of personal liberty and some consciousness of personal worth are probably essential to this curious by-product of social life, and besides this there must be opportunity to work.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_9_0	In fortunately placed savage societies, where the sheer necessities of life are easily obtained, the opportunity for creating opifacts or works of art during the long leisure hours is shared by almost every member of society. So that if any man happens to have creative invention he is likely to become an artist. The more so that, although the tyranny of social custom is very strong in certain directions, it has not generally elaborated any decided aesthetic prejudices; besides which the artist, as like as not, works for himself. The result is that although the opifacts of such peoples are rather elementary and do not imply the ambition to express any complex ideas, the proportion of genuine works of art to opifacts is generally very high. But even here there are as yet inexplicable waves of greater and less creative power, as, for instance, in the case of negro art which had long been declining in quality, even before the blighting influence of European civilisation had made itself felt.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_10_0	When we come to highly organised civilisations such as those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, to take early examples, individual self-esteem is probably far less wide spread. The great wealth and size of such communities gives to the ruler who symbolises in himself the whole social organism a far greater notion of his own pre-eminence and the ambition and power to advertise it in vast, complicated, and costly opifacts. This implies that the opificers are set apart from the rest of the community, and tend to be organised aesthetically. The continuity of a style no longer depends merely upon habits of imitation and similarity of reaction, but is actually inculcated by precept and habits of training. The result is that after a comparatively short period of real creative effort, during which the sensibility of artists establishes definitive forms, there follows a very long period when these forms are stereotyped. ‘This stereotyped period lasted in Egypt for many centuries. During this time the production of opifacts was more and more voluminous; they became more and more elaborate and magnificent, and yet true works of art hardly ever make their appearance. There was no need for them; the opificers supplied all that was required by society. After many centuries, in the reign of Akn-aten, a spiritual upheaval took place which again allowed of that particular free play of sensibility which produces works of art. This vital impulse, however, quickly disappeared and the organised production of opifacts with no trace of artistic feeling went
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_10_1	on as regularly as before.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_11_0	The Mesopotamian civilisation started with an even more powerful aesthetic interest than the Egyptian, but, after a certain number of clearly marked types had been established, it too settled down into traditional repetition which went on with only slight variations for many centuries; such changes as the Assyrians produced being indeed all in the direction of more literal representation and towards the neglect of all other aspects of form.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_12_0	It would take too long to give even in the barest outline a summary of the various moments in different civilisations when this peculiar activity of aesthetic creation emerges and then disappears into the never-ceasing stream of opifacture. But two or three periods are of interest to our inquiry. The Roman was a highly organised commercial civilisation, but it is noteworthy that not only did it have an immense output of opifacts with hardly the faintest gleam of aesthetic creation, but its leading citizens actually gloried in their want of aesthetic sensibility, regarding it, without any adequate psychological inquiry, as a proof of moral superiority.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_13_0	On the other hand, the great towns of Italy, such as Florence and Siena, had likewise an essentially commercial civilisation, and yet here during the Renaissance we get the extremely rare phenomenon of a people who actually preferred the artist to the pure opificer, so that the whole production of opifacts was for a time at least controlled and directed by artists who actually conceived the idea that all opifacts should be works of art and all opificers artists.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_14_0	The nineteenth century in England and France was again a period of extraordinary commercial development and organisation, but here we meet with a situation which is probably new in the history of art.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_15_0	The great wealth acquired by this civilisation encouraged an enormous production of opifacts, but unlike the great commercials of the Renaissance those of the nineteenth century showed a marked predilection for opifacts that did not even resemble works of art. In an earlier civilisation this would have led to the total submergence of artists; we should have had a state of things like that which obtained generally in Egypt and Rome. But in the nineteenth century the sense of individual worth and independence had been highly developed in the middle classes, and we have the curious phenomenon of the artist refusing to be suppressed, persisting in continuing his activities in spite of any discouragement, and in the face of the organised body of opificers. For the first time the opificer and artist recognised their respective differences of nature and purpose, although this distinction has not hitherto been sufficiently recognised to become enshrined in language.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_16_0	We find, then, that it is almost the rule of civilised life to produce a great many opifacts and to be quite indifferent to works of art.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_17_0	Just as organised religion can get along for ages without saintliness, so this vast social affair of opificers making opifacts can go on for ages without the special inspiration and the uncompromising conviction which denotes the artist and the work of art. And just as organised religion is generally highly suspicious of the saint, when he appears, so the opificers are generally very much perturbed when the artist appears. We may carry the analogy still further and say that, just as religions finally come to accept the saints and to use their creative force to heighten their own prestige, so the organised opificers finally accept the artist, and even come to believe that he was one of themselves, and to treat his memory as part of their inheritance. In fact, dead saints and dead artists are used as bulwarks of defence against living saints and living artists.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_18_0	There have been periods when, for some reason or other, the organised opificers were not so fixed in their ideas as to oppose vigorously the artist ; they accepted him without very much difficulty and adopted his ideas rapidly, and these are the great periods of creative activity. At such periods men create partly because they believe creation possible. But there are other times when tradition has hardened and grown dull, and when the creation of form seems to be a desperate venture — when it appears like a wanton attack on the system of society itself. At such times artists are accused of Bolshevism and moral depravity, and society begins to talk of calling in the police. In America they do call in the police, and even here they would step in if we tried to act certain well-known plays.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_19_0	There is one curious thing about artists and works of art — we have seen that they are not necessary to society, that the world can get along perfectly well without them, that they are generally unwelcome disturbers of the established harmony, spoilers of the feast ; but they are very difficult to forget. If their works remain these tend to become centres of disturbance, they exercise a violently stimulating action on a few spirits in each generation, making them in turn question the values of society, making them often discontented and what is called unpractical. It generally happens that the maladies thus provoked do not last long, and the victim generally forgets in middle age that he had it in his youth. You are many of you already inoculated by this feverish interest in spiritual things, but it is probable that society will help you to get over it and forget it ultimately altogether. You may be now in doubt whether Matisse or the winner of the Derby is the more important person ; when you have once settled down, merely to put such a question will appear the mark of an unbalanced character and a rather scandalous reputation.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_20_0	Much may be done by society to check the spread of this infection by making past works of art into what are called classics; this is in effect a process of mummification — the great poems are wrapped up in learned treatises and annotations, the pictures and statues are treated as sacred objects and gather gradually an appearance of unreality— they become objects of archeological research and, as such, almost entirely innocuous. It is well known, for instance, that it is possible for archeologists to handle the greatest masterpieces of sculpture without feeling any aesthetic emotion whatever. All these discoveries have been of great value to the world in preventing the too frequent occurrence of artists, and in avoiding the trouble of contemplating works of art.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_21_0	The Ecole des Beaux Arts is one of the most admirably equipped of these laboratories for inoculation against art. The youthful aspirant, who is generally a quite innocent schoolboy, arrives and for several years he works every day in a large building crowded in every part with huge copies of all the great masterpieces of the past. The greatest works of Greek sculpture become daily familiar to him in the shape of extremely dirty brown plaster casts ; Piero della Francesca’s Arezzo frescoes are revealed on the walls by copies originally made by some artist who had been already well inoculated; they therefore attenuate whatever is sharply accented and vital in the original, and, in the course of many decades, they have become in addition dusty, foxy and fly-blown. Raphael, Michelangelo, Mantegna are likewise brought before his daily notice in similar travesty. What wonder that at the end of his course he has become proof against any spiritual stimulus from the originals of these mummified remains. At the end of that time he is endowed with the highest opificer’s skill, and is spiritually prepared to produce opifacts which can be guaranteed entirely devoid of the aesthetic virus. He becomes a highly popular painter and fit to meet the President of the Republic at official functions.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_22_0	Let me give you another instance of how admirably society has learnt to protect itself. This week my university has conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters on an art critic who is a distinguished member of your university. The public orator recounted his services to art in what I believe was impeccable Ciceronian prose, but he let the cat out of the bag at the end when he wondered what one who had written so well of nineteenth century art could make of some of the modern works of art which are without head or tail; “quibus nec pes nec caput.” ‘This writer when he was a young man showed the greatest spirit and courage by championing Whistler and Degas against the virulent attacks of the opificers of the day. Neither university then thought of conferring a degree on him. But now that Whistler and Degas have been slowly absorbed into the social system, and no longer exercise the dangerous fascination they once did, their champion is rightly honoured for holding the fort against Whistler’s and Degas’ successors. All this is as it should be, and shows how admirably the social system works. Society wants opificers, but not artists — it needs opifacts but not works of art.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_23_0	"I need not remind you that the picture I have here drawn is very schematic. I have spoken of saints and artists as though they were a distinct species, easily recognised by some patent and well-authenticated markings. I need hardly remind you that this is not the case—that they are only types, more or less fully realised by a few individuals, only partially realised by others. There is, of course, every degree of shading between the pure opificer who is entirely immune from aesthetic feeling and the pure artist who has no possibility of compromise with commerce and the existing order. It is the same with opifacts and works of art. ""The whole business of the critic is to try to distinguish between them, and to isolate the work of art. We can recognise the extremes—we have little doubt that most modern official portraits are pure opifacts, and that Raphael’s Baldassare Castiglione is a work of art. In between, all sorts of intermediate states are possible. But the fact that we cannot ever draw a definite line between the two is no more an argument against recognising the opposing types than it is to say that we cannot draw the line between blue and green."
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_24_0	We have seen that the raison d’étre of opifacts is that in one way or another they confer prestige. Prestige on the individual who owns them, or on the community that orders them. In the early Middle Ages this prestige was acquired almost exclusively by the Church. We can see how clearly it recognised the importance of opifacts by the extent to which it devoted its wealth to the erection of extremely magnificent and imposing opifacts, the cathedrals and abbeys and churches which, when one considers the relative poverty of the time, must have absorbed an immense proportion of all the available wealth of the population. It so happens that many of these opifacts are works of art. Non-aesthetic opifacts are curiously rare in the work of the twelfth century, though even then they existed in greater quantities than people often suspect.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_25_0	With the constant growth of individual wealth and individual power the aristocracy began increasingly to acquire prestige by means of opifacts. In the seventeenth century in Holland the bourgeoisie also began to acquire quantities of elaborate opifacts, and that movement spread throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the nineteenth century a new phenomenon appears. The use of machinery led to an unexampled power of production, and it was gradually discovered to be worth while to produce immense quantities of objects at very low prices so as to attract a very large clientele— it was found to pay more to sell great quantities, at low prices, to poor people than to sell small quantities, at high prices, to rich. Then with the advent of the Prince Consort, and a new interest in the history of past art,
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_26_0	there came the delightful dream that the finest opifacts (even the finest works of art) could be produced mechanically on so vast a scale that everyone might own a masterpiece. That dream flowered in the great exhibition of the mid-century, and left the Crystal Palace as its visible symbol. It is all that is left of the dream. For it was, alas ! a pure dream—a hallucination.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_27_0	It was false because it started from the assumption that people (even all the people) want works of art. I hope I have shown that this is not the case — they want opifacts which confer prestige. But an opifact that anyone can possess does not confer prestige, and is therefore useless. Rarity, and the fact that other people want and cannot have the rare object that you possess, is essential to the whole business.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_28_0	Probably no one, however keen their love of aesthetic beauty, is quite free from the egoism which thus becomes associated with our idea of the opifact and even with the work of art. We see this in the case of bronzes which are capable of perfect mechanical multiplication. No one, however much he admires a bronze on purely aesthetic grounds, fails, if he is going to purchase it, to find out how many exactly similar pieces the artist purposes to make. Its rarity is part of its value to almost any owner.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_29_0	But the dream was also deceptive because it is very hard to harness machinery to the production of works of art. In the case of bronzes, I have shown that within limits it may be done. Etching is another case, though here the limits of multiplication are very narrow. Still, it would be untrue to say that machinery is fatal to the work of art. Its effect is to substitute an ideal exactitude for a felt approximation. Wherever the machine enters, the nervous tremor of the creator disappears. ‘The creator may adapt himself to this as in the case of the potter’s wheel. A pot made entirely by hand without a wheel shows that nervous tremor, that sensibility, in all its dimensions. The horizontal sections may approximate to a circle — none of them will ever be a true circle. It will be the artist’s felt approach to a circle. The vertical section, the galb, will likewise show only an approximation to some mathematical curve. If, however, the potter uses a wheel, the horizontal sections will presumably be true circles from top to bottom, but the galb will still express the artist’s sensibility. In this case we have come to allow for thus much of mechanical exactitude, and we concentrate our appreciation on the subtlety of aesthetic feeling which is shown in the galb and in the general proportions.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_30_0	We have yet to find out what machinery can and cannot do in conjunction with the artist’s sensibility. I believe it may be used far more successfully than it has been, but the main fact emerges, that the Victorian effort to produce works of art by machinery led to a terrible deception. And it was worse than this in its effect on the possibility of artistic creation. The fabrication by hand of all the minor objects of daily use had kept a number of people occupied, not indeed as artists but as skilled opificers, and the mere fact of being a skilled opificer, though it by no means implies any aesthetic sense, does tend to develop any latent aesthetic sense which a man possesses. ‘There is more chance that a hand weaver may develop a real sense of design than there is for one who manipulates the handles of a modern power loom.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_31_0	So that gradually all creative effort has been taken from the workman. Whatever creative effort there is, is all concentrated in the trade designer, and he too is handicapped by machinery. The machines once set up are capable of producing enormous quantities of goods very rapidly, but it is a very costly business to set up any particular design. ‘The manufacturer therefore is almost obliged to play for safety. That is to say, his design must be one that is likely not to offend any one — it must therefore look as like what people are already accustomed to as possible, and yet just have a suggestion of novelty. A really creative designer is therefore the last person whom a manufacturer can safely employ. He wants an opificer capable of either attenuating the design of some artist, or dishing up afresh the designs of past opificers of the same kind as himself. The manufacturer soon discovers that a really creative design has a certain violence and insistence, a spiritual energy, which is disquieting to people at first sight however much they may come afterwards to like it, and this disturbing, disquieting character puts the buyer off. Even if he likes it at first he wonders what others will say of it — whether the carpet or curtain he likes will add to his social prestige; and generally his wife knows at once that it won’t do, and he falls back on safety, by preference a safe novelty, for snobbery has
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_31_1	more subtleties even than love. Again we see that people want opifacts and not works of art.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_32_0	In the latter half of the nineteenth century commerce made a new discovery of the greatest importance, and one which affects our lives at every turn. The big industrialists discovered advertisement. This is not literally true; advertisement, as we have abundantly seen, is as old as opifacts, which are indeed, generally speaking, advertisement in one way or another—the statues of the Pharaohs were advertisements—but they discovered the enormous power of the trade advertisement. With increasing wealth and increasing population, and therefore the possibility of an almost unlimited clientele, they found that every £1000 put into advertising brought in much more than {1000 worth of increased profits. Of course this must be a diminishing return, since when all your competitors advertise as much as you do all start again at scratch.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_33_0	Trade advertisement is, of course, economically wasteful, and no society that produced its goods by co-operation for the general good would be likely to adopt it. But apparently the demand for goods is so elastic, people’s ideas of what they want are so capable of education, or perhaps I ought to say hypnotic suggestion, that advertising has become an ingrained habit of commercial undertakings. I suspect many of them of continuing to advertise from purely romantic reasons and without hope of direct reward. I suggest this because in many cases, where advertising still goes on as merrily as ever, all the apparently competing concerns are united in a single trust which has the whole business of producing a given article, say soap, in its own hands. In such a case advertising can only pay by making people buy more soap than they need. Since apart from that, the successful advertising of one kind of soap can only transfer a certain number of purchasers to that branch from another branch of the same business. These are, however, mysteries into which such a layman as myself has no right to pry. What I constate is the fact that advertisement has, in recent times, taken on a new complexion. It is tinged with a new poetry — a new romance. It is no longer the severely practical affair it once was; it brings about a new relation between the public and the great limited liability companies. There is a note of affectionate zeal
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_33_1	for the public in their communications. ‘The big companies pose as the friends and advisers of the public, they appear filled with concern for their welfare, they would even educate them and show them the way to higher and better things. The Underground tells the slum dweller of the beauties of nature in the country, it reveals the wonders of animal life at the Zoo, it inspires the historical sense by pictures of old London. The great railway combines tell of the glories of provincial England, and inspire an enthusiasm for the grandeur of modern locomotives. In fact, each of these great concerns tries to build up in the public imagination an image of something almost personal — and as such they begin to claim almost the loyalty and allegiance of the public they exploit.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_34_0	No doubt this has got to do with another interesting recent discovery of commerce. The early industrialist believed in increasing output and decreasing price. For some reason the modern industrialist finds his advantage in restricting output and increasing price. Advertisement is used not so much to induce us to buy as to make us willing to pay far more for things than they cost to produce. Thus the railway companies give us progressively worse and worse accommodation but, by advertisement, they produce in the public a non-critical state of romantic enthusiasm for the line. More and more the whole thing takes on an air of romance and unreality.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_35_0	In all this matter of hypnotism on a large scale the poster has become the great weapon of the industrial companies, and the poster designer their great ally. We have here a vast new business of making opifacts, with its own special technique and its own special methods of appeal to the imagination through the eye.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_36_0	What is interesting to me in this new business is that I see a possibility of commerce doing something to redress the balance in favour of art—that balance which it so ruthlessly upset in the other direction by driving all artists out of the business of designing for the textiles, pottery, etc., of ordinary use.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_37_0	For the poster is not a very expensive object. It is possible here for the industrialist to take risks which he would never take in setting up a textile design, or a design for linoleum, or for any of the objects of large scale production.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_38_0	Obviously, human nature being what it is, posters will very rarely be works of art. But there is a chance here and there that a work of art might pass muster both with the employer and the public. This chance is increased by the fact that in its present stage poster technique is in a condition of steady and continual growth. New experiments in the possibilities of printing, and in the effect of colour arrangements, are continually being tried. As yet these things have not hardened into too rigid a tradition. With a new opifact industry, and one which is still growing and as it were plastic, there is a greater chance for the artist than in one which has become ossified and fixed in its habits. Even the reaction of the public is more appreciative and less negatively critical in any form of expression which is comparatively new. This effect has often been observed. The sudden emergence of any new form of opifact generally provokes an effort at aesthetic creation, because, after all, the pure opificer can never imagine anything but a recombination of the old material. It requires the artist to conceive and materialise new formal matter. Thus it is that, generally speaking, new arts or newly revived arts begin straight off with a high potential of creative energy. It was so when the posribitity of stone vaulting led to the great outburst of energy which created the Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals. It was so again with the
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_38_1	discovery of printing. It was so that the Elizabethan age produced almost at a single blow the greatest masterpieces of English drama. On the other hand, the theatre has now become so highly stereotyped that new forms have to fight a long and exhausting battle against the organised opificers before they can get a hearing. The same applies to the painted picture where the opificers’ organisation is particularly strong and well developed, and is even backed by the State. But there is as yet no Royal Academy of Poster Designers, there is no fixed and traditional notion of the kind of thing a poster ought to be. There is as yet no pedantry, no culture, no lecturing, until to-night, to hamper and harass the man who happens to have a gift for expression in this medium. For all these reasons the art of poster design holds out opportunities of a kind that are all too rare in modern life. This exhibition tells me how far they have been realised.
1-16-art-commerce	doc_18_39_0	I fear that the ideas I have tried to outline in this lecture will strike many of you as consisting too much of the atrabiliar grumblings of a disgruntled elder. We are as much accustomed to the assumption that society encourages art as we are to the idea that religion ensues saintliness. In both cases we cling to these assumptions with a certain tenacity. We are nearly as much shocked when we realise that the academies are commercial undertakings as we are when it is forced upon us that many of the clergy are worldly-wise and self-seeking. Perhaps we could save ourselves a good deal of painful and unnecessary emotion if we were less exacting in our ideals, if we recognised that the real and pressing needs of society are not even in what are called works of art concerned with the higher spiritual adventures. It is well occasionally, even for the sake of the temper, to take a cold douche.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_0_0	PARNASSUS TO LET
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_1_0	Art-Forms decay and are continually renewed.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_2_0	The progress of science has a hand in this change.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_3_0	The primitive epic, the chanson de geste, the ballad were all for recital. Literature was then a temporal art, just as music still is for the vast majority of people. But with the invention of printing by Gutenberg about 1450 the course of literature began to be changed. There was no longer any necessity for poems and chronicles to be read aloud. Those who wished to, and were rich enough, could possess them, printed, as a book, and read and reread them at their will. Literature began to lose its temporal quality. A man could get to know a poem or a story so well that he could review it in retrospect as a whole, just as if it were a painting, and he standing back at the correct distance; whereas, previously, only the first and last lines with a few striking passages in between had remained in his memory, standing out like peaks above the intervening valleys sunk in mist. With the bound book present on his shelf, as soon as one part of the story or poem became dim, he could easily revivify his memory by rereading that part and so restore the image. Much modern poetry that is thought to be difficult and obscure is so only because the sequence of ideas is no longer temporal; it is logical, but its point of departure and point of return are dictated by the artist’s whim. The result is that at the first reading the poem is unintelligible, in
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_3_1	fact it cannot be understood until the last line has been read, the complete circle described, and the poet’s image recreated three-dimensionally in the reader’s mind.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_4_0	This change in the temporal quality of literature has altered the course of such art-forms as the epic, the chanson de geste, and the ballad. This is not to say that these art-forms are now never used. Mr Robert Graves has shown that it is still possible for the ballad to recur spontaneously in times of abnormality—but with a difference. Even Paradise Lost compared to the Iliad is like Liverpool Cathedral compared to Salisbury. The epic has passed by and crossed over towards the drama, as can be seen from Browning’s Ring and the Book and Hardy’s Dynasts.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_5_0	But what new art-forms can we point to?
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_6_0	The novel and the cinema.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_7_0	The novel is not much more than a century and a half old, despite Apuleius, Lyly, and Addison. Of course, all modern histories of the novel start at least one or two thousand years ago and trace minutely throughout all literatures the indications of its coming birth. Unfortunately no one noticed these indications at the time; and it was not until the novel was an accomplished fact that the old pointers were discovered standing and (what is more) all pointing in the same direction.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_8_0	The cinema is the newest of all the arts and has as yet barely come of age. Walt Whitman unconsciously was its prophet; and like the novel it has had its pointers too, but these are only just beginning to be discovered: in places Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra reads more like a film scenario than a drama, and what is Hogarth’s Marriage 4 la Mode but the first six-reel comedy? Its birth was the fruit of an unnatural attachment between the drama and painting, who called in science to act the midwife; and at times this offspring still betrays its bastard origin by making the mistake of imitating too closely either parent art. Most people will allow that the drama mothered the cinema; but such a paternity is certain to be called in question.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_9_0	Since the time of Cimabue, painting has been freed from the necessity of being the handmaid successively of religion, history, morality (not to mention high-class pornography) and Portraiture: this last by the scientific invention of photography in the last century. Without doubt painters will still continue to use all these as excuses to cover up the intolerable nudity of their aesthetic ideas. But to-day a young man wishing to have a likeness of himself finds a Cecil Beaton more reliable than a Picasso. In the photographer’s studio he will be photographed in a sequence of different positions with all the usual accessories, Apart from the question of the photographer’s imagination or a certain talent in the sitter, how far are we here from Charlie Chaplin in his one-man film, One A.M.? And, once Chaplin admitted, all the rest follows.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_10_0	The cinema (for the good of its soul!) started out without textbooks telling it how it should go about to work; and what it has learnt during these first twenty years of its life, it has learnt by experience. The technique of scenario writing has been vastly improved, so much so in Chaplin’s case that it has been improved away altogether, for his latest films have been directly created without written script. This is of importance, for it shows how completely the cinema has now succeeded in casting off the shackles of literature, everywhere except in some European and American backwaters where old faults and prejudices. still linger on. For too long literature poisoned the cinema by making her the most tempting offers of plots and titles —tempting, because the plots offered were ready-made and the titles of proved publicity value. Literature is one art, the cinema another: it was impossible that the cinema should continue to take orders from Lady Literature and live below stairs, And it is significant that out of the following random list of good films not one happens to be a screen adaptation of a novel or a play: The Cruiser Potemkin, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, The Woman of Paris, Warning Shadows, The Salvation Hunters, Vaudeville, The Pilgrim, Berlin, and The Marriage Circle. In all these the cinema has found, more by intuition than by anything else, her true technique.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_11_0	Apart from the superficial attraction, of literature, the cinema (as its origin made inevitable) has had to learn how to escape from the danger of dramatic scenes and pictorial shots. For many years intelligent appreciation of films was held up by the appalling stupidity of scenes, which may once have been dramatic on the stage, but which had been so literally translated into the cinema that they became deserts of monotony wherein long close-ups of the emotional heroine were divided from long close-ups of the passionate hero by wads of subtitles that were supposed to make articulate the incessant lip-service of the two stars. Producers have at last learnt the danger of retarding the visual action by subtitle after subtitle, and have even found it possible, as in the case of Warning Shadows, to produce quite intelligible films without any subtitles at all. Except in the case of comedies where a good joke is never amiss, it is safe to say that, the fewer and shorter the subtitles, the more chance for the film itself,
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_12_0	Similar, but not so obvious, is the danger of the pictorial shot. The most essential quality of the cinema being motion, it stands to reason that any Pictorial shot is apt to make a film static and to sap its dynamic force. Sometimes this is harmless. A still photograph of a landscape may act as an excellent jumping-off place at the beginning of a film, before the action has had time to gather way. A similar still is useful at the end, to bring the audience’s feelings back to the normal plane. Three stills of three different stone lions, shown in rapid succession at the beginning of the bombardment of Odessa in The Cruiser Potemkin, gave the same plastic and rousing effect as three notes blown on a trumpet. One 17 of the most notable moments in Berlin, was when the rhythmic acceleration emotional tension, and musical climax of the arrival by train were suddenly succeeded by quiet photographic stills; of the city, lifeless as a picture postcard in the dawn, of the smokeless factories, of the deserted streets: each accompanied by a low chord pianissimo. Still followed after still, like so many lantern slides, until down an exhausted street came the first wind of the day, blowing a piece of white paper along the dry pavement, over and over. As for pictorial shots, one of a prison scene in the prologue to Vaudeville was obviously based on a well-known painting of Van Gogh’s La Ronde des Prisonniers, which (it
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_12_1	seems not to be so well known) Van Gogh painted after Doré. But the mere fact that the prisoners were in motion was sufficient to preserve the prologue from any ill effect that an absolutely static shot might have had on it. On the other hand, there was a scene in The Woman of Paris, where a mother was bowed in grief over the bier of her son, which, although not directly reminiscent of any known painting, was definitely pictorial in quality, and left an unpleasant feeling in the audience’s mind, partly of false emphasis and partly of sentimentality.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_13_0	These few examples are sufficient to show that the cinema has gained its experience in a hard field, threatened by false bogeys, hindered by the absence of tradition. Before it can go forward with fresh strength and more directness of purpose, the ground it has covered must be critically examined and the foundations of a true tradition laid. The time for that has now come. But although during the last few years the cinema has drawn forth a host of ephemeral literature (most of it French), none of it seems to give serious consideration to what (at least to judge 5 the other arts) ought to be a most important element in any film—namely Rhythm. Film-producers themselves naturally have little spare time or inclination to experiment—their job is too risky for that. And so it is that the knowledge of rhythm in the cinema remains extremely vague. For though a certain amount may be gathered from analogy with the other arts, yet in the end the true laws and manifestations of rhythm in the cinema will have to be found out by trial and experiment in that medium alone. What follows in this essay is a loose and all too inadequate attempt towards a synthesis. Any analogy shall be drawn mainly from English poetry where the workings of rhythm can most easily be followed: analogies drawn from painting or from music (however modern) are liable to prove deceptive.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_14_0	Gerard Manley Hopkins, to whom the debt of the Sitwells, Miss Stein, and even James Joyce is obvious but as yet unacknowledged, wrote in 1883 (two years before Stevenson’s pleasant but too curious essay on the technical elements of style in literature) a preface to his unpublished poems, wherein we find the following passage concerning the rhythm of the English five-foot verse — “If, however, the reversal (trochee for iamb) is repeated in two feet running, especially so as to include the sensitive second foot, it must be due either to great want of ear or else is a calculated effect, the superinducing or mounting of a new rhythm upon the old; and since the new or mounted rhythm is actually heard and at the same time the mind naturally supplies the natural or standard foregoing rhythm, for we do not forget what the rhythm is that by rights we should be hearing, two rhythms are in some manner running at once and we have something answerable to counterpoint in music, which is two or more strains of tune going on together, and this is Counterpoint Rhythm.” ‘This passage is most interesting and enlightening, especially for its inaccuracies. The musical analogy is inexact, probably owing to some confusion in Hopkins’s mind over the exact meaning of tune. One is left with the suspicion that he did not realise that a single unaccompanied tune can have rhythm (just as well as a passage in intricate counterpoint), so long as the single
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_14_1	tune in itself implies a metre. It is because Hopkins ignores metre that he is led into the difficulty of making unnecessary distinctions between two or three different rhythms, whereas what he calls natural or standard rhythm is really metre, and his counterpoint rhythm, rhythm itself. With these substitutions the passage becomes quite comprehensible. It seems that wherever we find rhythm there must be, underlying, some simple metre. In French verse this metre may be numerical, a fixed number of syllables to each line; in English accentual, as in the following scheme, --|--|--|.-|.-; in music a common metre is made up by four regularly recurring accents of the following roughly proportional intensities: 4 2 3 1. Consequently, in examining rhythm in the cinema we must look for what can be used as an underlying metre. The metre found may not be strictly adhered to; but, as always, exceptions will only help to prove the rule. To begin with, a certain number of examples will be collected, wherein several films have appeared to possess obvious, pleasing and successful rhythms.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_15_0	An excellent example of simple episodic rhythm, remarked by most people, occurred in Chaplin’s great film, The Woman of Paris. ‘There the arrival of a train in a provincial station was indicated by a gradually slowing succession of lighted oblongs thrown across the station wall from the carriage windows. Simultaneously with this motor pattern the woman (who was standing on the platform) moved her face across in the same direction, but very much more slowly, as she watched the arrival of this train that was to take her to Paris. A local metre had been set up, regular visually, geometrically progressive temporally; and above that, a simple movement, sufficient to make the whole scene absolutely thrilling.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_16_0	An intelligent experiment in the rousing of emotion by rhythmic acceleration was made in the first edition of an English film, The Little People. The first shots of the film showed the slow beating of a drum to attract people to the performance of a marionette show. One saw people hear the drum and start swaying their heads in time with it. Then, as the speed of the beating increased, one saw the villagers going to the show, walking at first, children tripping up in their hurry, and finally the audience clapping rapidly, Following three isolated drum taps, the curtain rose and the show began. How successful this his opening scene would have been with the public cannot be said, as the film was only released in a most unfortunately mutilated condition.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_17_0	But it is doubtful whether any film before The Salvation Hunters showed a conscious effort made to set up a continuous rhythmic feeling; and there it only persisted strongly through the first half of the film, the scene of which was laid on a mud-dredger. This dredger worked continuously, either the claw-bucket travelling up and down dribbling filth, or the crane-neck swinging out over the mud-barge and back. This was movement in three dimensions of a slow but regular kind, and it proved to be soothing and not distracting. Other shots had the usual fixed backgrounds of walls, doors, etc. And these two series of scenes were alternated in certain simple ratios, according to the demands of the action as it moved through one scene to another. Here, at first, it is difficult to say whether we have an example of simple or counterpoint rhythm in its truest sense: whether the regularly recurring movements of the dredger, or the simple permutations and combinations of the scenes with moving and fixed backgrounds, provide the metre.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_18_0	This film, made at a negligible cost by an enterprising group of Hollywood unemployed, came in for some curious treatment at the hands of the critics. Iris Barry in her disappointing book, Let's Go to the Pictures, speaks of it as follows:— “ Chaplin, one heard, hailed the picture as a masterpiece. When Chaplin opens his mouth, all the critics yap in unison. The Salvation Hunters was acclaimed throughout the world. It was a dismal failure. When it had gone its rounds, Chaplin said that he had thought he would see whether the cinema audiences had any sense. He thought he would praise a bad picture and see how many would swallow what he said.” This little trick of Chaplin’s lacks confirmation: let it suffice to point out that on the strength of this picture alone he took Georgia Hale and starred her in The Gold Rush in the place of Lita Grey. Iris Barry was not the only critic who misunderstood the importance of The Salvation Hunter, Other critics made the same mistake probably because they were unused to any sensible handling of rhythm in films, and distrusted the term itself on account of its misuse by directors of the so-called absolute or abstract films that hail from Paris.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_19_0	The average Englishman is so afraid of having his leg pulled by Jean Cocteau or any of Cocteau’s friends to-day, that he is apt to lose his temper instead of laughing. Just as Comte Etienne de Beaumont’s drawing-room ballet, Mercure, as irresponsible as a charade, annoyed the London critics when Diaghilev put it on in the summer of 1927, so the Comte’s abstract film, entitled A Quoi Révent les Feunes Films? puzzled and upset the cinema critics in 1925. The truth is that the film proved to be faintly amusing but plotless. There was no interest to link together the jumble of haphazard photographs, many of which had obviously been based on the studies of Man Ray. Entracte was a little better because it contained at least the shadow of an idea, scenes of an eccentric funeral being shown alternately in quick and slow motion. Then came the Ballet Mécanique of Fernand Léger, George Antheil, and Dudley Murphy, of which the French critic, Monsieur Charensol, has spoken as_ follows :—“Usually in every film there are two absolutely distinct ele: ments, the subject and its realisation: the first appealing to the intellect and the second to the visual sense, But in the Ballet Mécanique the authors have entirely done away with the subject, leaving the spectator free to concentrate on the visual realisation. This is composed of a succession of pictures: animate and inanimate objects, machines, tools, and geometric forms, following each other in obedience to a preconceived rhythm.” Nothing could
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_19_1	be clearer or more preposterous. Probably the best of all these films has been Man Ray’s own Emak Bakia, the Basque title of which emphasises its lack of pretentiousness. This film did not aim at being a complete work of art; it was content to offer itself merely as a sequence of extracts from a sensitive artist’s notebook. And that is really what all the other abstract films are— just a collection of rough jottings and fragments, valuable only in so much as they have improved somewhat the range and standard of a photography whose only previous licence had been to photograph all its fluffy heroines fou at sentimental moments, and have given directors a clue for such abstract aberrations as might be dictated by the subject of their films—for example, the dream in The Nibelungs, the acrobatic and the fair scenes in VY audeville, the machinery in Berlin and Metropolis —and for such superimpositions as ma be found in the German World War films and Gance’s Napoleon, or such virtual superimpositions as the stock exchange, factory, and war scenes in Pudowkin’s End of St Petersburg, which are alternated so quickly that the eye can no longer distinguish between them and take them in separately.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_20_0	It is not the abstract film, but the right use of the abstract shot, that is important in so far as cinematic rhythm is concerned, because the abstract shot Provides an easy and obvious way of obtaining contrast and emphasis. That its full possibilities have not yet been exploited can be seen in quite minor films, such as Monte Blue’s Wolf’s Clothing, where an enterprising producer suddenly provided an excellently rhythmic scene on a New York subway where a train had got out of control, and also some very creditable attempts to portray the awakening feelings of a drunk man: distorting lenses being used on the people he saw, the furniture magnified to three or four times its usual size, and the actions of the bewildered man slightly slow-motioned.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_21_0	The conclusion arrived at after the examination of abstract films, that it is not the abstract film but the abstract shot that is likely to prove of importance where cinematic rhythm is concerned, provides a clue that may be well worth following up. What is a shot? A shot is any length of film taken by the camera without break, and occupies normally the same time on the screen as in reality. As soon as the camera man ceases to turn the handle, the shot ends, even though the same scene, the same characters, may be used for the next shot. Although the shots are continuous on the screen (except where divided by subtitles, during which the rhythm of the film, and the acceptance of that rhythm by the audience, remains in suspense), yet the passage from one shot to another usually indicates a little temporal gap or mental comma; and may be said to act as a cesura. Naturally, care is taken during the cutting of a film to Tun the shots together in such a Sequence that the minimum of discomfort is experienced by the eye in jumping from one to another, The travelling camera has sometimes been used to try to smudge out these But the result is, that though the main parts of the shots have a fixed focus, the same as before, they are linked by a kind of no-man’s-land, of little importance in itself, because during the time that the camera its focus and
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_21_1	imitates the mannerism; of the human eye it is practically jm. possible for any new movement of importance to be initiated. Op occasions this can be quite effective, although its use needs to be much more restrained than it was in The Rat Nevertheless, it may be truly said that these cesuras punctuate a film. We shall see from Vaudeville how important +t is that they should arrive at the just moment, not a fraction of a second late; and in The Salvation Hunters we have already found it necessary that where they divide two sets of scenes of different characteristics they should occur at intervals determined by suitably simple ratios.’ Then, may it not be that the basis of cinematic metre is caesural and not accentual? that rhythm is built up by motion and emotion deployed from shot to shot? whether in a continuous pattern, or a richer and more complicated woof wherein a certain thread of motion or emotion, instead of being developed straight forward, is dropped out of the pattern for a time, only to be taken up again later and the loose thread drawn on right across the intervening warp?
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_22_0	It may be objected that a film has its accents just as much as a piece of music; that since a film makes its appeal to an audience through the particular to the general, so an accent is bound to occur as each particular point is made. This is true, A film certainly has its stresses, which may be caused in various ways; decrease of focal distance, lengthening of time value, any significant motion on the part of the actors. But these stresses are irregular in occurrence and always go to build up, oF drop away from, one of the climaxes in a film. Their growth arises out of the inner necessity of the subject, and so they cannot correspond to the regular accent that is the fundamental of musical metre. For, in any work of art, metre is a foundation which must be clearly established, or at least suggested; once set going it persists mechanically. Rhythm is superimposed and is organic. Rhythm and metre may be said to set each other off like colours shot. In a film it is the caesura alone whose recurrence is frequent and regular enough to warrant its use as the basis of cinematic metre.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_23_0	Rhythm appears to be most obviously successful in a film when motional and emotional rhythms alternate, and the appeal to the spectator is at once visual and mental, there being no question of doing away with the subject nor of leaving anyone free to concentrate on the visual realisation alone, since that, rather than emphasise rhythm, would destroy it altogether.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_24_0	The device where part of the action passes on a moving vehicle, whether car, tram, bus, or train, has (of course) been a favourite one with the producers of comedies ever since the earliest days of the cinema. But its possibilities can best be seen in such intelligently made films as Buster Keaton’s General, Harold Lloyd’s For Heaven’s Sake, and Charlie Chaplin’s infinitely more subtle Pay Day, where a service of midnight buses, which poor Charlie seems fated not to catch, act as metronomes and imprint their peculiar rhythm on the close of the film. Such motional scenes must be made with great restraint if they are to prove successful. Although movement is the breath of life to the cinema, yet it is of no use to photograph movement and nothing but movement. Without continued reference to the norm anything extraordinary eventually becomes meaningless and commonplace. Movement loses its effect if it is not contrasted with the firm and well-set earth. That is why, when Harold Lloyd gets on a bus with a handful of drunk men, it is necessary for the camera to pretend not only that it too is on the bus in order to photograph their antics at close quarters, but.also that it is a common pedestrian on the sidewalk who sees this strangely driven vehicle come careering down the street towards him. Similarly, in Vaudeville, the audience in the Winter Garden sees the acrobats swinging like little white pendulums high up in the roof of the
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_24_1	hall; and the acrobats see the audience, walls, lights in the ceiling, walls, audience far below them, walls, lights in the ceiling, in one continuous flux and reflux. Giddiness.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_25_0	It is not so easy to give examples of how emotion may be deployed from shot to shot. To take a simple case: when in the Ufa production of Cinderella the sister cut her foot in order to fit it to the shoe, the Succeeding scenes where she appears, pale and suffering, in her bridal robes and leaning on her mother’s arm, would have lacked their tense rhythm, had not the audience known that every movement she made must have been agony, and that she was only supported by her mother’s determination. Better still, the opening of Chaplin’s Pilgrim:—First shot: A warder comes out of a prison-gate and pastes a notice on the wall. A close-up of the notice reveals information about an escaped convict and a photo of Charlie. Second shot: A bather re. turns to find his clothes gone and a convict’s uniform left in their place, Third shot: A curate walking up a Station platform. A gust of wind blows off his hat. He retrieves it and turns round. It is Charlie. Three strands making a single knot.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_26_0	If cinematic metre is caesural, it follows that it is of the greatest importance that the cesuras should occur at the correct moments in a film ; that is to say, that the shots should be of the tight length, neither too long nor too short, and that they should be combined with each other in the best order. When this is has been done well by a film-editor, the result ought to be perfectly balanced and satisfying. But who is to say whether the censors and exhibitors of the world will allow such a film to be shown in its perfect mint form? As is well known, each country, each town, has its board of censors: the result is that Russian films are almost taboo in Western Europe, the true Metropolis may not be shown in England, nor the true Vaudeville in Birmingham, and even Chaplin (on the merest whisper of “divorce’’) is liable to be banned in Chicago and the United States. Metropolis as seen in England was quite different from the-original film: thrills were deleted, a dance scene banned, the whole moral of the story altered: consequently the acting became illogical, the psychology false, and the balance and rhythm of the original film completely wrecked. Yet Dawn, though banned by Sir Austen Chamberlain in England, was shown wherever the local authorities chose to license it.”
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_27_0	This is a disgraceful state of affairs, The cinema, unlike literature, is an immediately international art. It is already much more international than music or painting can hope to become for many years, despite cheap colour printing and the radio. Not only does a film ignore frontiers like an aeroplane, but it comes nearer the heart of mankind than any of the other arts. If the muses may be suspected of political tendencies, the deity that presides over the cinema is certainly Socialist. As Walt Whitman cried when he had succeeded in enticing the Muse over from empty Parnassus to the New York Exposition, “ She’s here, installed amid the kitchen ware!”’—he might have added prophetically, “the Cinderella of the arts.” Although so young, the cinema has proved its worth, to judge from the influence it has already exerted on the other arts. What modern ballet owes it can be seen from La Pastorale ad the slow-motion scenes in The Blue Train and Apollo Musagetes. Even James Joyce in Tristan and Isolda seems to be emulating the universality of the cinema in his attempt to break down the barriers of language by using words or word-fractions taken indiscriminately from about a dozen different tongues. And the works of Cendrars and Ramuz are widely known. ‘The cinema is too old still to be treated as a naughty child. And yet the censor seems to find it necessary to mutilate masterpieces like Vaudeville and Metropolis (and, for that matter, Chaplin’s Woman of
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_27_1	Paris) before they can be shown in this country.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_28_0	Could we not take a salutary lesson from Germany? There The Cruiser Potemkin was first shown with cuts, most of these coming in the famous Odessa Steps’ scene. Naturally Meisel’s music had to be similarly mutilated to match. But when early in 1928 the censor licensed the whole of Eisenstein’s later, but less successful, film, October, or Ten Days that Shook the World, there remained no adequate reason why the Potemkin should still be banned. With considerable wisdom the censor rescinded his decree and at last allowed this masterpiece to be shown in its entirety. Only then could the full effect of the Steps’ scene be judged, one of the most perfect rhythmic episodes in any film. Given the visual: metre of the long glissando of the steps, descending terrace by terrace, Eisenstein superimposed on it four different movements: (1) The regular descent of the firing-line, step by step, step by step—Fire! (This movement emphasised strongly the metre of the steps.) (2) The panic of the crowd flying helter-skelter, those shot falling dead, those wounded trying to crawl into safety. (3) The contrary motion of the mother, who, finding her son shot dead by her side, picked up his body and returned with it to defy the firing-line. (4) The young widow, who, being shot, fell against her baby’s perambulator so that it began to bump down the steps; bump, bump, bump—a short landing— and then, bump, bump, bump, bump, again. This movement was the most surprising of all, because
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_28_1	the most incongruous; yet it, together with a great part of (3), had been entirely cut away from the first version. As shown in Berlin in 1928, this scene was perfect with the tragic perfection of the opening movement of Beethoven’s Last Symphony ; whereas such deliberately thought-out rhythmic constructions as Lotte Reiniger’s silhouette films, Achmet and Cinderella, can never achieve more than the delicate perfection of Cimarosa.
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_29_0	Then, let what cutting has to be done be done at the time that a film is edited. for it is almost entirely to the editor of film that its ultimate rhythm is due, and any later alteration of his work will only upset the balance of the whole. How much depends on careful editing can be seen from a comparison of Vaudeville with Chaplin’s Gold Rush. It is one of the signs of Chaplin’s genius that he never holds a scene too long. In The Gold Rush there is a moment when Charlie prepares a New Year's Eve party, the guests do not turn up, and the whole film is on the point of sliding into the most embarrassing sentimentality. A moment longer and the thing were done. But that moment never comes. Just on the right side of time Chaplin switches off and executes the miraculous Oceana Roll. The situation is saved by one of the most brilliant moments in the whole history of the cinema. In Vaudeville, however, the tempo of the film is deliberately slowed up in order to give the murder scene a ponderous impressivity. But it is undoubtedly slowed up just a fraction too much. The impassivity of Emil Jannings ceases to awe one and begins to become slightly ludicrous—a dangerous thing to happen at the climax of any film. Had the editor cut two or three seconds, no more, off the length of most of the shots, that mistake would have been avoided
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_29_1	(although it is always possible that those few seconds represent just the difference between the Teutonic and the British temperaments).
2-14-parnassus-to-let	doc_19_30_0	But, the point to be emphasised is this, that cutting is primarily the duty of the film editor, and not of any haphazard board of censors. Any later interference with a film is bound to upset the continuity of both its metre and rhythm, to react unfavourably on the minds and nervous systems of the audience, and to give as unsatisfactory results as a performance of Beethoven’s Eroica with the “false horn entry” removed, or an exhibition of Raphael’s Transfiguration with the figure of the epileptic boy and his outstretched arms cut out. Perhaps a solution of these difficulties would be for the League of Nations to set up an international board of censors that should pass all films or cause them to be modified, once and for all. But that, no doubt, is too simple an ideal for these hard times. Oxford–Clifton–Potsdam.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_0_0	IBSEN AND THE ACTRESS
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_1_0	I CANNOT but think, as I stand here, of my predecessors in this place. No one can have had a greater sense of profit or a deeper pleasure than I in the stores of learning, the profundity of criticism, above all, the deep and moving intellectual sympathy which have been offered here to the memory of the great Norwegian. I had not realised, and it is a reassurance to think, that Ibsen is so alive to-day-so present to the challenging mind and the discriminating enjoyment.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_2_0	"But in spite of indebtedness for my share in gratitude for all this, I have felt here, at intervals, a little lonely for the ""helpers and servers"" of that institution to which, after all, we owe Henrik Ibsen. If I except a brief reference by Mr Desmond McCarthy (and very telling it was!), among all this wealth of testimony from the study there has been hardly a thought for, and there has been no mention of, the stage. I came to wonder was this partly because the theatre is still homeless among the people who speak Shakespeare's tongue? One day that will be considered. You have been hearing about Ibsen as man; as an influence in European literature; as dramatist. To ""place"" Ibsen as any of these, we must remind ourselves afresh of the chasm that may exist that so often does exist-between the literature of the drama and the literature of the stage. Apart from the mass of unacted, unactable prose plays, there is the great body of poetry in the form of drama. The readiest instances in the English language are, of course, Tennyson and Browning; and there is the whole company of poets before and after those two, who created in dramatic form a literature that never became stage literature. Unlike Ibsen, the authors of these poetic dramas made their reputations without help from the stage, and if they live at all, they live on the printed page. But Ibsen's poetry, apart from what went into his"
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_2_1	acted plays, would not have carried his name outside Scandinavia.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_3_0	"I cannot lag behind anyone in recognising that Ibsen was first and foremost a poet, if I think only of ""Paa Vidderne"" and the collection of exquisite little early lyrics. But my point is, without the help of the stage the world would not have had an Ibsen to celebrate; and without Ibsen the world would not have had the stage as it became after his plays were acted. The reason I am here this afternoon is because of Ibsen's significance to actors. Apart from the fact that no one being can speak for the people who acted Ibsen, the choice of the one was felt to be restricted-an effect of the mere passing of time. I think the organisers of this series of lectures were right to try to find a woman. I mean to set out my reasons for that presently."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_4_0	In dealing with Ibsen's significance to the acting profession, I naturally think of one actress in particular whose view would have been immensely interesting. I mean, of course, the woman to whom belongs the lasting honour of being the first person to play a great Ibsen part in England-Janet Achurch. As she is not here, I was going to say-but in a sense she is here, vivid in the consciousness of all who ever saw her act. As she cannot, however, speak to you, I think the makeshift-best I can do in this direction is to tell you a little about my own recollection of the first production of A Doll's House, for-thinking of the title of this paper-that occasion, in addition to so much else, stood for Ibsen and at least three actresses: Janet Achurch, Marion Lea, and myself, plus I don't know how many more, who were to be affected by that day's happening. I do not know whether I had ever heard Ibsen's name till the afternoon when I went with my friend Marion Lea to see her friend act A Doll's House.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_5_0	I cannot think such an experience was ever ushered in with so little warning. There was not a hint in the pokey, dingy theatre, in the sparse, rather dingy audience, that we were on the threshold of an event that was to change lives and literatures. The Nora of that day must have been one of the earliest exceptions-she was the first I ever saw-to the rule that an actress invariably comes on in new clothes, unless she is playing a beggar. This Nora, with her home-made fur cap on her fair hair, wore the clothes of Ibsen's Nora, almost shabby, with a touch of prettiness.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_6_0	I never knew before or since anybody strike so surely the note of gaiety and homeliness as Janet Achurch did in that first scene. You saw her biting into one of the forbidden macaroons, white teeth flashing, blue eyes full of roguery, her entire Wesen inviting you to share that confidence in life that was so near shipwreck. The unstagey effect of the whole play (and that must have owed much to Charles Charrington) made it, to eyes that first saw it in '89, less like a play than like a personal meeting-with people and issues that seized us and held us, and wouldn't let us go.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_7_0	"I remember Marion Lea wanted desperately to play Nora-in the provinces, in America, anywhere. Strangely, it didn't take me like that. Janet Achurch's acting had carried me clean out of myself. I didn't even feel on that first occasion, as I did later, that the Tarantella dance was, from the point of view of the theatre, somehow a mistake. But the famous lines: ""Millions of women have done so"" and it burst upon me that I had been living here these eight years with a strange man, and had borne him three children ""-for all time they should be said just as they were first said, and by just that person. I have never changed my mind about this though I have seen a number of Noras, in various countries."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_8_0	To go to that play once was to be compelled to go again. The second time I was able to follow the sheer acting more-shall I say professionally. I am afraid I felt I knew about acting. I certainly had seen a good many plays. In an old-fashioned stock company on the other side of the Atlantic, where an evening's entertainment would sometimes consist of a curtain-raiser, the main drama of the evening, and an afterpiece, I had played, during two years (by dint sometimes of doubling and even trebling), nearly three hundred. parts. I had afterwards gone touring in romantic melodrama with the father of Eugene O'Neill; after that, in Shakespeare with Edwin Booth. Yes, I thought I knew. And this Doll's House, with its little-known actors and its poverty-struck setting, was not only the most thrilling, it was the most satisfyingly done modern play I had ever seen. Each person in the caste seemed the heaven-appointed person for the part. Charrington again! But the acting of the children must have been Janet Achurch's own contribution. They were not stage children at all. They clung about her, they really laughed, they got in her way, they belonged to her. My one moment of anxiety, that second time of seeing (and I was always to feel this), was a doubt whether the dance would come off. Somehow for me it never did quite-in spite of all the actress could do. The Tarantella seemed a piece of theatricalism, Ibsen's one concession
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_8_1	to the effect-hunting that he had come to deliver us from. As for Dr Rank, Charrington never, in all his days, played anything so well as that funereal figure. He gave Rank a creepy uncanniness that goes creeping over me even in memory. There was death and the grave in his long dull-coloured face. In the early part of the play Nora's warm bright confidence splintering against that tombstone of a man gave one a chill.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_9_0	I do not remember much about the Mrs Linden of that occasion except that, looking on from the front, she seemed just right. It fell to me, a little while after the Charrington season, to play Mrs Linden with a wholly different caste. Coming close to her, as acting a part brings close, was another matter, and in that quite common fact there is significance for people who care to understand the function of the actor. In mere length Mrs Linden is a small part, but it was for me a great experience. I despair of giving an idea of what that little part meant, not only of vivid pleasure in working at and playing, but of-what I cannot find any other word for than self-respect. Ibsen was justifying what some of us, with very little encouragement, had blindly believed about the profession of acting.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_10_0	In setting down my notes I have not aspired to be historical. I have tried quite simply to fix a personal impression. It was Marion Lea who first saw the opportunity in Hedda Gabler and invented our going to see Mr Heinemann, the publisher, to get the acting rights. That settled (provisionally to our finding a producer), we undertook to see the managers; but they were more difficult of access, so we wrote to them. We saw them ultimately and tried to persuade them that their indifference and their loathing were equally mistaken. We failed.

2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_12_0	"Then Marion Lea, again the initiator, urged me to join her in producing Hedda ourselves. This was courageous of her. It was no secret that we had, neither of us, any money; but Marion had a jewelled bracelet and I had a small treasure that I could throw in the pot. With these ""securities"" we borrowed from an amiable friend £300, and set to work."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_13_0	The first thing was to enlist the cooperation of the translators, Sir Edmund Gosse and Mr William Archer. They showed a singular confidence in us-all unproved as we were. They allowed. us to collaborate in a somewhat more speakable version for stage use. I don't mean for a moment that we had anybody's consent to the least alteration of Ibsen's meaning, but we were allowed to alter Ibsen's English dress. We found in this latitude a very inspiring kind of freedom. I have somewhere several sets of page proofs of Hedda Gabler as they left the hands of the translators; one set scored over in Marion Lea's handwriting, one with mine, and our final agreed recommendations. These Mr Archer fully criticised, sometimes denounced and utterly declined; but the final result was, I think, a very speakable, very playable version, no less faithful—I have always held more faithful to Ibsen. Anyway, it was immense fun. Then choosing the caste as though it were choosing a Cabinet at a national crisis . . . then the rehearsals, everybody keen, excited, pulling with us (few London plays have ever been rehearsed longer or more carefully). Then the production!
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_14_0	"The press notices were a palpitating excitement, especially those we jeered at-with anxiety in our hearts. But we put on a bold front. Mr Clement Scott understand Hedda?-any man except that wizard Ibsen really understand her? Of course not. That was the tremendous part of it. How should men understand Hedda on the stage when they didn't understand her in the persons of their wives, their daughters, their women friends? One lady of our acquaintance, married and not noticeably unhappy, said laughing, ""Hedda is all of us."""
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_15_0	Hedda was not all of us, but she was a good many of us-so Mr Grant Allen told the public. Anyway, she was a bundle of unused possibilities, educated to fear life; too much opportunity to develop her weakness; no opportunity at all to use her best powers.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_16_0	I shall lay myself open to the charge of too great simplicity, but I am going to remind even such an audience as this of some aspects of the Hedda story. It is some time since the play has been. done in England, but that is not my real reason. My real reason is, this one of Ibsen's actresses did not see Hedda as she was described by any critic, and Ibsen still seems to me to side with the actress.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_17_0	"Hedda is first represented to us as an enviable person. We hear of what General Gabler's daughter had ""been accustomed to""; how fond she was of dancing, and shooting at a mark and riding with her handsome father-she ""in her long black habit and with feathers in her hat."" ""So beset with admirers,"" Aunt Julia says-who would have dreamt she would marry a mere professor? Well, she wasn't on the scene sixty seconds before it was clear she knew there was joy in life that she hadn't been able to grasp, and that marriage only emphasised what she was missing."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_18_0	"It was never any wish of mine to whitewash General Gabler's somewhat lurid daughter. Even in the heat and glamour of that first personal contact with a great Ibsen part, I was under no temptation to try to make her what is conventionally known as ""sympathetic."" One surviving recollection bears witness to that. Among those who never much cared about Ibsen, but always came to see him acted, was Lady Bell. At the first performance of Hedda she was thought by her companion to be in danger of lending herself too much to the glamour of the play; so this friend of Lady Bell's youth warned her: ""It's all very exciting, but I wouldn't trust her round the corner-that woman. playing Hedda."""
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_19_0	"I had the best of reasons for not trying to mitigate Hedda's corrosive qualities. It was precisely the corrosive action of those qualities on a woman in Hedda's at circumstances that made her the great acting opportunity she was-in her trevolt against those commonplace surroundings that the bookworm she had married thought so ""elegant""; her unashamed selfishness; her scorn of so-called womanly qualities; above all, her strong need to put some meaning into her life, even at the cost of borrowing it, or stealing the meaning out of someone else's."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_20_0	"Hedda's first and dearest dream had been to find contacts with life through the attractive young man of letters, Eilert Lövborg. That hope ended in driving him from her at the point of a pistol-not, as one eminent critic has said, ""in the ostentation of outraged purity which is the instinctive defence. of women to whom chastity is not natural."" Hedda drove Lövborg from her in disgust; disgust at the new aspects of vulgar sensuality which her curiosity about life had led him to reveal. She never denied it was her doing that he revealed these things; it was not her doing that he had them to reveal. They made her gorge rise. The man who had wallowed in that filth must not touch Hedda Gabler-certainly not fresh from the latest orgy. The effect of that experience, plus the conditions of her own life and upbringing, was to throw her into marriage with the least ineligible man she can find who is decent, and no one can deny that poor Tesman was entirely decent."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_21_0	"The result was not peculiar to Ibsen characters. In one form or another, as we all know, it is a commonplace in the history of people whose nervous system. generates more force than the engine of their opportunity can use up. Hedda speculates, like many another woman, on the opportunity politics would give to her husband, and, through him, give to her; but she is too intelligent to have much hope of Tesman in that direction. She is no sooner home from her boring honeymoon than she finds that a girl she had looked down on and terrorised at school-shrinking, gentle Mrs Elvsted -has reclaimed the dissipated Lövborg. More than that, largely by her faith in him, she has helped him to write what they are calling a work of genius. The timid Thea Elvsted has actually left her husband and her home to watch over Lövborg, so that he may not fall into evil courses again. How on earth had it all come about? Hedda, by turns, worms and coerces the facts out of Thea: ""He gave up his old habits. not because I asked him to, for I never dared do that; but he saw how repulsive they were me-so he dropped them."""
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_22_0	"As simple as that! None of those shady stories told to Thea-but the pretty little fool has his dreams in her keeping; she has helped to turn them. into reality. And Hedda has lost him. For Hedda there would be ""others."" The insinuating Judge Brack, with his aristocratic profile and his eyeglass, is already at the door-but never the man whose faith in his own genius, faith in life, had given Hedda the one respite she had known from mean standards, mean fears."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_23_0	"Those had been times for Lövborg, to too, of respite from his meaner self. d Hedda's passion for external material s beauty was not the only kind of beauty ΟΙ ts that swayed her. Lövborg in his moods. of poetic exaltation had given her, too, a glorious sense of freedom, of daring. She had her phrase for those high he moods of his. It was the phrase that, with a truly Ibsenite irony, became famous in England in a totally different When Hedda asks eagerly, ""Did he have vine leaves in his hair?"" she was not inquiring whether Lövborg was drunk with the fiery Scandinavian punch, but whether he had been tasting a diviner draught. She was using her symbol for his hour of inspired vision, which had had for her, too, its intoxication. Now she has lost all that-unless -unless she can break the hold of this irritating little goose. Thea had said she'd been so frightened of Hedda at school. Well, she should be frightened again!"
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_24_0	"It is a commentary on actress psychology that though in those days I accepted, and even myself used, the description of Hedda as a ""bloodless egoist,"" I was under no temptation to play her like that. Here I was in debt to Ibsen's supreme faculty for giving his actors the clue-the master-key-if they are not too lofty or too helplessly sophisticated to take it. Ibsen's unwritten clue brought me close enough to the ""cold-blooded egoist to feel her warm to my touch; to see Hedda Gabler as pitiable in her hungry loneliness-to see her as tragic. Insolent and evil she was, but some great celebrators of Ibsen have thought more meanly of Hedda than the text warrants. She knew, she did not deny, her prime weakness. Lövborg in the second act says of Thea in Hedda's presence:"
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_25_0	"""And then she is so brave!"" ""Good heavens,"" Thea exclaims, ""I brave!"" ""Very courageous,"" he rubs it in, ""where your comrade's interests are concerned."" ""Ah, yes,"" says Hedda, ""Courage. If only one had that."" ""What then?"" Lövborg insists. ""Then life would perhaps be livable after all."" She knew there was no deadlier enemy than Fear; but her circumstances (and they were in essentials the circumstances of all women ""of position,"" as it is called) made Fear the master of the show. To the timid, trembling Thea, who yet could brave public opinion-having less to lose-Hedda had found herself crying out:"
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_26_0	"""Oh, if you could understand how poor I am! And fate has made you so rich!"""
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_27_0	Hedda was poor-but not one of the abject poor; for she had one form of courage. It is a form despised by a good many people who themselves lack it. I mean that courage that can refuse life on certain terms. These, in Hedda's case, were terms which two kinds of women find quite tolerable. They are the simple women and the slavish-minded women. The simple sort would have made a comfortable humdrum life with Tesman. Behind Tesman's back the slavish-minded would have led an accidenté existence with Judge Brack and his successors.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_28_0	I do not remember that even the friendliest critics took in the real significance of the ending of the first act.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_29_0	"""Well,"" Hedda says to her husband, ""I shall have one thing at least to kill time with.... ""Oh, thank heaven for that!"" says poor Tesman fervently. ""What is it, Hedda? Eh?"" ""My pistols,"" she says. ""Your pistols!"" Hedda (with cold eyes): ""General Gabler's pistols."" She goes out. . . . ""No, for heaven's sake, Hedda darling don't touch those dangerous things! For my sake, Hedda! Eh?"" He rushes into the garden after her and the first curtain comes down."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_30_0	Long before she met the man she married, Hedda had looked on General Gabler's pistols as possible allies. They had early prevented Lövborg from adding Hedda Gabler to the list of his Mademoiselle Dianas and other light o' loves. At the last, Hedda was to give Lövborg a pistol that he might do with it what she had long meant to do, if life should fail her utterly. It will be remembered there were two pistols. She still had one for her own need.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_31_0	It is perhaps curious Ibsen should have known that a good many women have found it possible to get through life by help of the knowledge that they have power to end it rather than accept certain slaveries. Naturally enough, no critic, so far as I know, has ever noticed this governing factor in Hedda's outlook, her consciousness of one sort of power, anyway-the power of escape. The reason men have not noticed the bearing this had on Hedda's character and fate seems plain enough. Certainly the particular humiliations and enslavements that threaten women do not threaten men. Such enslavements may seem so unreal to decent men as to appear as melodrama.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_32_0	Ibsen not only knew better; he saw further than the special instance. He saw what we at that time did not; I mean the general bearing of Hedda's story. This so little concerned us when we were producing Ibsen that we never so much as spoke about it.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_33_0	You may be able to imagine the excitement of coming across anything so alive as Hedda. What you won't be able to imagine (unless you are an actress in your twenties) is the joy of of having in our hands-free hands- such glorious actable stuff. If we had been thinking politically, concerning ourselves about the emancipation of women, we would not have given the Ibsen plays the particular kind of wholehearted, enchanted devotion we did. give. We were actresses-actresses who wouldn't for a kingdom be anything else. We got over that; but I am talking about '89-'91. How were we to find fault with a state of society that had given us Nora and Hedda and Thea? Unlike Mlle Brandes, whom I was later to see playing Hedda in Paris, Marion Lea and I never thought of there being anything difficult to understand in the Ibsen women till people challenged them. Then in sheer selfdefence we became controversial. But whether we met abuse or praise, in the end it was all grist to our mill. It was tonic to be attacked. To be understood and praised was-whatever it was, we came out of it all, without loss of the bracelet or the small treasure, with a tidy balance at the bank, with a kindling memory and a lesson.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_34_0	"Ibsen had taught us something we were never to unlearn. The lesson had nothing to do with the New Woman; it had everything to do with our particular business-with the art of acting. Events, after Hedda, emphasised for us the kind of life that stretched in front of the women condemned to the ""hack-work"" of the stage. That was what we called player ing even the best parts in plays selected by the actor-manager. The important managers were actors then. I cannot say that without saying it was good to work under John Hare at the Garrick. But all that interval after Hedda was secretly filled with waiting for the next Ibsen."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_35_0	"Marion Lea had married and gone to act in her husband's plays in America. There was an actress (I cannot but think) after Ibsen's own heart!—skilled, eager, highly sensitive. Above all, her own striking originality did not stand in the way of complete loyalty to her author. She already had a singularly keen appreciation of the aims and ends of good stage-management. It should be said that having to do with Ibsen greatly heightened that faculty. She had complained before that so many actors ""play the lone hand""; they consider their business is to make their part-whatever it is-the pivot of the play. Perhaps more than anyone I ever worked with, Marion Lea had the sense of playing with the whole orchestra. Yet she had a perception of character so independent, clean-cut, daring, that people who had seen her success in Shakespearean comedy hardly recognised her when she came on, for instance, as Thea. And make-up had very little to do with this genius for individualising. Her performance of Thea was a triumph of art; but so unforced, so true to life, that people wouldn't believe she was acting at all. The result was she never had one-tenth of the recognition she deserved. Many of the critics and most of the managers mistook the self-discipline of the artist for limited range."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_36_0	One of the few who did not fall into this error was Mr Bernard Shaw-and who could recall Ibsen days without seeing that figure flash across the scene, leaving a trail of laughter, sometimes of consternation, but always a more vivid sense of our material and our opportunity. Mr Shaw was the man, or more truly he later became the man, who could have heightened and prolonged the value of certainly one of Ibsen's actresses; for, beyond any critic of his day, Mr Shaw was master of the power to make reputation. Had he been in a position to write some of the things he said about the performance of Thea, the managers' eyes would have been opened. As it was, Marion Lea was early lost to Ibsen and the English stage.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_37_0	"But Ibsen's fame in England had now reached a point where there was competition among actresses-as to who should have the next play: ""If it's actable,"" said the cautious. ""How can we know?"" There was no knowing. One of Ibsen's characteristics was his refusal to tell even his most trusted friends a word about any work till it was finished. The nearest he ever came to such confidences was in his answer to Mr William Archer's rather hopeless questioning as to what was to be the subject of the next play: ""Some devilry or other,"" said Ibsen, and he wouldn't promise his devilries to any actress-or to any theatre. He wouldn't even commit the play in book form to any English publisher."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_38_0	On top of this refusal, the most enterprising publisher of the day, Mr William Heinemann, dropped his scores of other no preoccupations and posted off to Norway. Mr Heinemann had heard that Ibsen was said never to give an interview to anyone he didn't know, and to few enough of those he did know.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_39_0	If I remember, Ibsen was not induced to make an exception of Mr Heinemann; but the great man's son was tracked me down. Sigurd Ibsen said he was as much in the dark as anybody; he didn't even know whether it was a man's play es or a woman's play. But he was properly alive to the significance of having on the door-step a cosmopolitan publisher like Mr Heinemann--or perhaps he realised there wasn't another like him. Mr Sigurd knew, anyway, here ok was the man associated with the best business results an Ibsen play had yet achieved in English, so he promised he would see what he could do. Mr Heinemann came home convinced he as good as had the nearly finished play in his pocket.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_40_0	"He was right. By the time the first sheets of The Master Builder reached England it was not necessary for me to wait yet longer while the translators turned it into English, or I think I should have died of impatience. I had the experience ""frightfully thrilling"" (""forfaerdelig spendende,"" as as Hilda Wangel would say) of being able by then to read Ibsen in the original. That promised a collaboration closer still."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_41_0	The play was found to be open to the charge of symbolism. That view did not, to my own consciousness, hold me then as it did on re-reading the other day. At the first contact, thirty-five or thirty-six years ago, we thrilled to it as poetry. The actress recognised it as life-the kind of life that is most real in the theatre, that breathes freest on the stage. With The Master Builder Ibsen would, I believed, make his way to one of the established theatres.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_42_0	I naturally took the play first to the theatres where I had already played, or to those which had offered engagements. I was told The Master Builder was simply unintelligible. Oh, it was wild! It was irritatingly obscure. It was dull, it was mad, it would lose money. I had one special friend among English managers. Two or three years earlier Beerbohm Tree had put me in the position (a lucky one for an alien and a stranger) of understudying the leading lady's part in his theatre and, as it turned out, of playing her for a while. But for this I should have spent just four days in England instead of the rest of my life; so, amongst other things that I owed to that versatile, generous, and lovable man, I owed to Beerbohm Tree the chance of being in the Ibsen saga at all. That much to explain why, though Mr Tree loathed Ibsen and had been one of the most vehement and picturesque fulminators against him, I finally took The Master Builder to the Haymarket.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_43_0	Beerbohm Tree turned out to be the one manager in London who could see anything in the play. To my delight, what he could see was himself. Yes, he would produce it-on condition. The condition was that we should lift the play out of its sordid provincialism. We would do this by dint of making the people English; more particularly by making the Master Builder a sculptor. Many people in those days would have backed that view.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_44_0	Fortunately, Mr Herbert Waring was ready to join me in the responsibility of an producing The Master Builder as Ibsen ce had written it. Herbert Waring it was who found a man ready to put down a small sum that would give the play a it hearing. For me there had been just one haunting doubt about the enterprise: Was I quite young enough to et stand for the Younger Generation the knocking at the door? Among the see reassurances on this score I have always ht cherished the one Sir Edmund Gosse set down in his preface to the play. But h before that was written, while we he worked on The Master Builder, doubts were not so much solved as clean forhe gotten in the sheer absorbed delight y of dealing with such material and with such helpers.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_45_0	It was a great piece of fortune to have as fellow-actor and fellow-producer such a partner as Mr Waring. He and I gathered together what I still think was an ideal caste; and we had for chief ally the one man in the world who could do most for our author, and, by that road, do the most for us. Standing guard over Ibsen's interests, at every rehearsal, note-book in hand, a kind of Recording Angel setting down our sins of omission or commission, was William Archer. Nothing escaped him, from the slightest inflection of voice, the significance of the smallest gesture or most fleeting expression, up to the crescendo of a climax or the capital crime of the smallest alteration of the text--nothing escaped that note-book. Either on the intolerable instant, or at the end of the act, he would have us each and all up for judgment.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_46_0	No one could speak out of experience of Ibsen and the actress in England and not make some, however inadequate, recognition of the bridge between the two-the bridge built and guarded by William Archer. I have sometimes wondered what the interview would have been like had the great Duse herself made to Mr Archer her request for a happy ending to A Doll's House!
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_47_0	I doubt if it has ever happened before, 1 that a distinguished critic and man of letters has given so much of his thought and time, given a patience tireless, remorseless, to the guardianship of another man's renown. William Archer did all this not for Ibsen only. He did it for dramatic literature; he did it for love of and understanding of the stage. As for the value to the actors of the keen participation in our work of such a mind and such an equipment, only we, who worked with him, know what Ibsen's plays in England owed to William Archer.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_48_0	The dress rehearsals of all the Ibsen plays I was concerned in producing brought round us the inner circle of Ibsen supporters, and a few of those who in our opinion ought to be supporters. These select but agitating parties often gave the unprofessional critic a chance to help us. Among far more important instances a minor one comes back. Someone said Hilda's dress was not quite right. I knew it. I had meant to have another fitting; but Herbert Waring and I had not only ourselves to think about, we had everybody else's part and clothes to think about, the rightness of the scenery, the lighting, the advertisements, the seating all the thousand things that make up a production as a whole. I certainly was not going, on this last breathless evening, to worry about Hilda's collar. At the end of that final dress rehearsal Henry James joined the group on the stage.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_49_0	"He interrupted somebody's congratulations: n: ""Yes, yes-but . . ."" he fixed me with his melancholy look, ""to-morrow a thousand eyes will be pecking at you, pecking at that""-he touched the collar. So, late, tired, I went off in a hansom to see what could be done to make Hilda more impeccable. But whether the collar lay flat or rode up didn't matter to me as I stood waiting outside The Master Builder's door at the first matinee performance next day, knapsack on back, alpenstock in hand, a prey to those alarms and desperations that seize the actor before he goes on, worst of all that nearly last moment before the cue, when when you have barely time to measure the distance between the door that opens on the stage and that more merciful door that opens on the street; when you know you want nothing so much on earth as to be able to rush out of the theatre, take ship and vanish forever, or even get yourself run over; somehow, anyhow, to be rid of the awful need to march on to that battlefield, as Mr Bernard Shaw rightly calls the stage."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_50_0	"Ibsen, more than any author I have known, comes to the rescue of the actor in this misery. He never deserts you, if you trust him. Practically he ""does it"" for you. On Solness's line:"
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_51_0	"""Yes, just you see, Dr Herdal, presently the Younger Generation will come knocking at my door. . ."" Herdal laughs: ""Well, what if they do?"" ""What if they do? Then there's an end of Halvard Solness."" (Knock.) ""What's that?"" ""Someone at the door."" Solness braces himself. ""Come in,"" he says, and all the rest was inevitable. . ."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_52_0	"This is one of the plays-the other is Rosmersholm-that I won't pretend to speak dispassionately about, so it may be as well there is time to say very little. No other (and I played in seven of Ibsen's)-no other ever seemed so much mine as The Master Builder. No other ever brought such a sense of. release, such conviction of having the audience with me, and at the same time such freedom from the yoke of the audience. It was as if one played not only, as the good old advice directed, ""to the last row in the gallery,"" but farther still-to an audience invisible. And this feeling was not disturbed by the sounds from the actual audience. They took the ""points"" I thought obvious, and they took the points I least counted on anybody's noticing-my points, those that Ibsen had left me not merely to make, but to find. And, in addition to these, there was in the air (any actor will understand) that unmistakable response-and I do not mean applause-a response no less to the ""little devil"" in Hilda than to her thrilling sense of the adventure of living; a response to that queer mixture of wildness and tenderness; that determination to have her own imperious way, crossed by the necessity to feel what other people were feeling. Ah, that made it very difficult for Hilda to be only the wild bird of prey-made it impossible."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_53_0	"In one or two of the scenes it used to seem to intensify that sense of closeness to the spirit of the thing, to say over to oneself (silently, of course) the equivalent phrase or so of the original. I remember in particular the scene where Hilda, in one of her most trolllike moods, happy, impudent, sits at the feet of the Master Builder's wife on a little stool in the garden. It is just before the elder woman's pitiful confidences. Partly to make Mrs Solness feel she likes being with her, Hilda has to say: ""Ah, here one can sit and sun oneself like a cat."" That particular Hilda used to hug her knees and, in the little pause, say to herself the Norwegian sentence Ibsen had put in Hilda's mouth. The warmth, the idle sensuousness of those words: ""Ahher kan en rigtig sidde og sole sig som en kat""-they made for a contrast in mood that needed no outward emphasis. from the actress when a little later, alone with the Master Builder, after the wife is gone, he asks: ""Are you cold, Hilda? I think you look cold."" She answers: ""I have just come up out of a tomb."" One thing happened during that time. I used to think I would like Ibsen to have known-though you will very likely wonder why. We had been told that exceedingly critical person, Lady Burne-Jones, had been saying remarkable things about the play. No one, least of all she herself, had"
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_53_1	"expected it to take such hold of her. When some time later I met her this is what she said: ""After the final curtain I remember being disturbed by the applause. When I got up to go, I was bewildered to find the theatre empty; and I never knew how long I'd been sitting there alone."" I have not spoken of the tremendous sensation created by that first production of Ghosts which we owed to Mr Grein, nor the imperishable impression made by Duse in the same play thirty years after, nor of her Lady from the Sea--those are great chapters by themselves."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_54_0	The steps by which other Ibsen plays, individually and in a cycle, came to be put on the stage in this country by an Ibsen actress is another story. I like to remember I had a hand in the production of Little Eyolf where Janet Achurch again made an unforgettable impression in the long part of Rita, while Mrs Patrick Campbell, in the small part of the Rat Wife, gave perhaps the most haunting and perfect piece of poetic acting that stands to her credit.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_55_0	"Just so ""right"" as they were in Little Eyolf, just so wrong was my old friend Miss Genevieve Ward as the wife of John Gabriel Borkman in the play of that name. Miss Ward was a fine example (especially in Shakespeare parts) of the actress of the old school. She had found appreciation the round world over; but nothing would induce her to listen to Ibsen's prompting. Her ears were full of the stage directions of all the Sydney Grundys of the last fifty years. It was instructive, if infuriating, to see how her refusal to take her cue from her new author-how the need she seemed to feel to show a sense of humour and tragedy superior to Ibsen's -affected disastrously not only herself but others."
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_56_0	And this brings me to my final point. Ibsen's relation to the player is either singularly close, or, in effect, complete detachment. More than anybody who ever wrote for the stage, Ibsen could, and usually did, collaborate with his actors. I do not mean that he ever consulted one of them; the collaboration was a subtler thing than that. Ibsen was by training so intensely un homme du théâtre that, to an extent I know in no other dramatist, he saw where he could leave some of his greatest effects to be made by the actor, and so left them. It was as if he knew that only so could he get his effects-that is, by standing aside and watching his spell work not only through the actor, but by the actor as fellow-creator.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_57_0	There are over-many instances for citation here, but Ibsen's principle is worth emphasising. All that he seemed to require of the actor was that he should not be too conceited, or too hopelessly divorced from naturalness to be fit to collaborate with such a playwright-a poet who, with all his consummate craft, had taken Nature for his master-mistress.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_58_0	Given actors moderately intelligent, content to trust Ibsen to put them into the right Stimmung, they find Ibsen has done precisely this. By the power of his truth and the magic of his poetry he does something to the imagination. that not only gives the actors an impetus, but an impetus in a right direction. And I do not say the right direction. Whatever direction the individual gift and temper of the actor inclines to, the effects that Ibsen leaves. him to make are Ibsen's effects. Just as much they are Ibsen's when, in one actor's hands they turn out one thing, and in another actor's something different-different except for their incomparable freshness, their air of startling spontaneity, of being made to fit the player or the player born to play the part.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_59_0	Ibsen's deep knowledge of human nature, coupled with this sixth sense of his the sense of the theatre-was less clouded than in most writers by a desire to dramatise himself; and in saying so I have not forgotten Brand or Peer Gynt. Certainly, as he grew older, as his experience ripened, he was more and more interested in and more aware of the effect of modern life on women.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_60_0	My hope has been to show you the grounds on which the title of this lecture may be justified, for my own position is, that no dramatist has ever meant so much to the women of the stage as Henrik Ibsen. This is no less true although many admirable artists have never played him. They do not know, perhaps, that the parts they have made successes in would not have been written but for Ibsen. I am not criticising their judgment; it is probmably sound. With exception of the very greatest-the great, as Duse was great-people who have been a good while on the stage are less likely to show Ibsen at something like his full value than people whose talent is still mobile and comparatively modest, receptive. Make no mistake, you must let Ibsen play you, rather than insist on your playing Ibsen.
2-15-ibsen-actress	doc_20_61_0	"""Collaboration."" Maeterlinck has said: ""Il y a une plus haute collaboration que celle de la plume-celle de la pensee et du sentiment."" One of the highest of all is, surely, this collaboration between playwright and player. To those of us who were given a share in shaping for the stage some of Ibsen's characters it is an unfading glory of memory that there was a moment when, led by him, we ""mounted right to the top""-and heard harps in the air."
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_0_0	PREFACE
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_1_0	The three essays composing this small book were written several years ago for publication in the “Times Literary Supplement,” to the editor of which I owe the encouragement to write them, and now the permission to reprint them. Inadequate as periodical criticism, they need still more justification in a book. Some apology, therefore, is required.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_2_0	My intention had been to write a series of papers on the poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: beginning with Chapman and Donne, and ending with Johnson. This forbidden fruit of impossible leisure might have filled two volumes. At best, it would not have pretended to completeness ; the subjects would have been restricted by my own ignorance and caprice, but the series would have included Aurelian Townshend and Bishop King, and the authors of “Cooper’s Hill” and “The Vanity of Human Wishes,” as well as Swift and Pope. That which dissipation interrupts, the infirmities of age come to terminate. One learns to conduct one’s life with greater economy: I have abandoned this design in the pursuit of other policies. I have long felt that the poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, even much of that of inferior inspiration, possesses an elegance and a dignity absent from the popular and pretentious verse of the Romantic Poets and their successors. To have urged this claim persuasively would have led me indirectly into considerations of politics, education, and theology which I no longer care to approach in this way. LI. hope that these three papers may in spite of and partly because of their defects preserve in cryptogram certain notions which, if expressed directly, would be destined to immediate obloquy, followed by perpetual oblivion. T.S. ELIOT I. JOHN DRYDEN
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_3_0	If the prospect of delight be wanting (which alone justifies the perusal of poetry) we may let the reputation of Dryden sleep in the manuals of literature. To those who are genuinely insensible of his genius (and these are probably the majority of living readers of poetry) we can only oppose illustrations of the following proposition: that their insensibility does not merely signify indifference to satire and wit, but lack of perception of qualities not confined to satire and wit and present in the work of other poets whom these persons feel that they understand. To those whose taste in poetry is formed entirely upon the English poetry of the nineteenth century — to the majority — it is difficult to explain or excuse Dryden: the twentieth century is still the’ nineteenth, although it - may in time acquire its own character. The nineteenth century had, like every other, limited tastes and peculiar fashions; and, like every other, it was unaware of its own limitations. Its tastes and fashions had no place for Dryden; yet Dryden is one of the tests of a catholic appreciation of poetry.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_4_0	He is a successor of Jonson, and therefore the descendant of Marlowe; he is the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century. Once we have mastered Dryden—and by mastery is meant a full and essential enjoyment, not the enjoyment of a private whimsical fashion — we can extract whatever enjoyment and edification there is in his contemporaries — Oldham, Denham, or the less remunerative Waller; and still more his successors—not only Pope, but Phillips, Churchill, Gray, Johnson, Cowper, Goldsmith. His inspiration is prolonged in Crabbe and Byron; it even extends, as Mr. van Doren cleverly points out, to Poe. Even the poets responsible for the revolt were well acquainted with him; Wordsworth knew his work, and Keats invoked his aid. We cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless we fully enjoy Dryden; and to enjoy Dryden means to pass beyond the limitations of the nineteenth century into a new freedom.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_5_0	All, all of a piece throughout! Thy Chase had a Beast in View; Thy wars brought nothing about; Thy Lovers were all untrue. 'Tis well an Old Age is out, And time to begin a New.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_6_0	The world's great age begins anew, The golden years return, The earth doth like a snake renew Her winter weeds outworn: Heaven smiles, and faiths and empires gleam Like wrecks of a dissolving dream.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_7_0	The first of these passages is by Dryden, the second by Shelley the second is found in the “Oxford Book of English Verse,” the first is not; yet we might defy anyone to show that the He, second is superior on intrinsically poetic merit. It is easy to see why the second should appeal more readily to the nineteenth, and what is left of the nineteenth under the name of the _ twentieth, century. It is not so easy to see propriety in an image which divests a snake of “ winter weeds ”; and this is a sort of blemish which would have been noticed more quickly by a contemporary of Dryden than by a contemporary of Shelley.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_8_0	These reflections are occasioned by an admirable book on Dryden which has appeared at this very turn of time, when taste is becoming perhaps more fluid and ready for a new mould. It is a book which every practitioner of English verse should study. The consideration is so thorough, the matter so compact, the appreciation so just, temperate, and enthusiastic, and supplied with such copious and well-chosen extracts from the poetry, the suggestion of astutely placed facts leads our thought so far, that there only remain to mention, as defects which do not detract from its value, two omissions: the prose is not dealt with, and the plays are somewhat slighted. What is especially impressive is the exhibition of the very wide range of Dryden’s work, shown by the quotations of every species, Everyone knows “ MacFlecknoe,” and parts of “Absalom and Achitophel”; in consequence, Dryden has sunk by the persons he has elevated to distinction — Shadwell of Settle, Shaftesbury and Buckingham. Dryden was much _ more than a satirist; to dispose of him as a satirist is to place an obstacle in the way of our understanding. At all events, we must satisfy ourselves of our definition of the term satire ; we must not allow our familiarity with the word to blind us to differences and refinements; we must not assume that satire is a fixed type, and fixed to the prosaic, suited only to prose; we must acknowledge that satire is not the same thing in
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_8_1	the hands of two different writers of genius. The connotations of “satire” and of “wit,” in short, may be only prejudices of nineteenth-century taste. Perhaps, we think, after reading Mr. van Doren’s book, a juster view of Dryden may be given by beginning with some other portion of his work than his celebrated satires; but even here there is much more present, and much more that is poetry, than is usually supposed.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_9_0	"The piece of Dryden’s which is the most fun, which is the most sustained display of surprise after surpise of wit from line to line, is ""MacFlecknoe.” Dryden’s method here is something very near to parody; he applies vocabulary, images, and ceremony which arouse epic associations of grandeur, to make an enemy helplessly ridiculous. But the effect, though disastrous for the enemy, is very different from that of the humour which merely belittles, such as the satire of Mark Twain. Dryden continually enhances: he makes his object great, in a way contrary to expectation; and the total effect is due to the transformation of the ridiculous into poetry. As an example may be taken a fine passage plagiarized from Cowley, from lines which Dryden must have marked well, for he quotes them directly in one of his prefaces. Here is Cowley:—-"
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_10_0	Where their vast courts the mother-waters keep, And undisturbed by moons in silence sleep. . . Beneath the dens where unfledged tempests lie, And infant winds their tender voices try.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_11_0	"In ""MacFlecknoe"" this becomes:--"
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_12_0	Where their vast courts the mother-strumpets keep, And undisturbed by watch, in silence sleep. Near these, a nursery erects its head, Where queens are formed, and future heroes bred; Where infant punks their tender voices try, Where unfledged actors learn to laugh and cry, And little Maximins the gods defy.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_13_0	The passage from Cowley is by no means despicable verse. But it is a commonplace description. of commonly poetic objects; it has not the element of surprise so essential to poetry, and this Dryden provides. A clever versifier might have written Cowley’s lines; only a poet could have made what Dryden made of them. It is impossible to dismiss his verses as “ prosaic”; turn them into prose and they are transmuted, the fragrance is is gone. The reproach of the prosaic, levelled at Dryden, rests upon a confusion between the emotions considered to be poetic — which is a matter allowing considerable latitude of fashion - and the result of personal emotion in poetry; and, in the third place, there is the emotion depicted by the poet in some kinds of poetry, of which the “ Testaments” of Villon is an example. Again, there is the intellect, the originality and independence and clarity of what we vaguely call the poet’s “point of view.” Our valuation of poetry, in short, depends upon several considerations, upon the permanent and upon the mutable and upon the transitory. When we try to isolate the essentially poetic, we bring our pursuit in the end to something insignificant; our standards vary with every poet whom we consider. All we can hope to do, in the attempt to introduce some order into our preferences, is to clarify our reasons for finding pleasure in the poetry that we like.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_14_0	With regard to Dryden, therefore, we can say this much. Our taste in English poetry has been largely founded upon a partial perception of the value of Shakespeare and Milton, a perception which dwells Upon sublimity of theme and action, Shakespeare had a great deal more; he had nearly everything to satisfy our various desires for poetry. The point is that the depreciation or neglect of Dryden is not due to the fact that his work is not poetry, but to a prejudice that the material, the feelings, out of which he built is not poetic. Thus Matthew Arnold observes, in mentioning Dryden and Pope together, that “their poetry is conceived and composed in their wits, genuine poetry is conceived in the soul.” Arnold was, perhaps, not altogether the detached critic when he wrote this line; he may have been stirred to a defence of his own poetry, conceived and composed in the soul of a mid-century Oxford graduate. Pater remarks that Dryden-
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_15_0	"""Loved to emphasize the distinction between poetry and prose, the protest against their confusion coming with somewhat diminished effect from one whose poetry was so prosaic."""
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_16_0	But Dryden was right, and the sentence of Pater is cheap journalism. Hazlitt, who had perhaps the most uninteresting mind of all our distinguished Critics, says—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_17_0	"""Dryden and Pope are the great masters of the artificial style of poetry in our language, as the poets of whom I have already treated - Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton - were of the natural."""
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_18_0	"In one sentence Hazlitt has committed at least four crimes against taste. It is bad enough to lump Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton together under the denomination of ""natural""; it is bad to commit Shakespeare to one style only; it is bad to join Dryden and Pope together; but the last absurdity is the contrast of Milton, our greatest master of the artificial style, with Dryden; whose style (vocabulary, syntax, and order of thought) is in a high degree natural. And what all these objections come to, we repeat, is a repugnance for the material out of which Dryden's poetry is built."
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_19_0	It would be truer to say, indeed, even in the form of the unpersuasive paradox, that Dryden is, distinguished principally by his poetic ability. We prize him, as we do Mallarmé, for what he made of his material. Our estimate is only in part the appreciation of ingenuity: in the end the result is poetry. Much of Dryden’s unique merit consists in his ability to make the small into the great, the prosaic into the poetic, the trivial into the magnificent. In this he differs not only from Milton, who required a canvas of the largest size, but from Pope, who required one of the smallest. If you compare any satiric “character” of Pope with one of Dryden, you will see that the method and intention are widely divergent. When Pope alters, he diminishes; he is a master of miniature. The singular skill of his portrait of Addison, for example, in the “ Epistle to Arbuthnot,” depends upon the justice and reserve, the apparent determination not to exaggerate. The genius of Pope is not for caricature. But the effect of the portraits of Dryden is to transform the object which they contemplate ; as were transformed the verses of Cowley quoted above:
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_20_0	A fiery soul, which working out its way, Fretted the pigmy body to decay: And o'er informed the tenement of clay
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_21_0	"These lines are not merely a magnificent tribute. They create the object which they contemplate; the poetry is purer than anything in Pope except the last lines of the ""Dunciad."" Dryden is in fact much nearer to the master of comic creation than Pope. As in Jonson, the effect is far from laughter; the comic is the material, the result is poetry. The Civic Guards of Rhodes--"
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_22_0	The country rings round with loud alarms And raw in fields the rude militia swarms; Mouths without hands ; maintained at vast expense, In peace a charge, in war a weak defence ; Stout once a month they march, a blust’ring band, And ever, but in times of need, at hand ; This was the morn, when issuing on the guard, Drawn up in rank and file they stood prepared Of seeming arms to make a short essay, Then hasten to be drunk, the business of the day.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_23_0	Sometimes the wit appears as a delicate flavour to the magnificence, as in “Alexander’s Feast”:—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_24_0	Sooth'd with the sound the king grew vain ; Fought all his battles o’er again; And thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_25_0	The great advantage of Dryden over Milton is that while the former is always in control of his ascent, and can fise or fall at will (and how masterfully, like his own Timotheus, he directs the transitions!), the latter has elected a perch from which he cannot afford to fall, and from which he is in danger of slipping.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_26_0	food alike those pure Intelligential substances require As doth your Rational ; and both contain Within them every lower faculty Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_27_0	Dryden might have made poetry out of that; his translation from Lucretius is poetry. But we have an ingenious example, on which to test our contrast of Dryden and Milton: it is Dryden’s “Opera,” called The State of Innocence and Fall of Man, of which Nathaniel Lee neatly says in his preface :-—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_28_0	Milton did the wealthy mine disclose, And rudely cast what you could well dispose: He roughly drew, on an old-fashioned ground, A chaos, for no perfect world were found, Till through the heap, your mighty genius shined.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_29_0	In the author’s preface Dryden acknowledges his debt generously eniough :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_30_0	“The original being undoubtedly, one of the greatest, most noble, and most sublime poems, which either this age or nation has produced.”
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_31_0	The poem begins auspiciously :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_32_0	Lucifer: Is this the seat our conqueror has given? And this the climate we must ayes for Heaven? These regions and this realm my wars have got; This mournful empire is the loser’s lot: In liquid burnings, or on dry to dwell, Is all the sad variety of hell.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_33_0	It is an early work; it is on the whole a feeble work; it is not deserving of sustained comparison with “ Paradise Lost.” But “all the sad variety of hell”! Dryden is already stirring; he has assimilated what he could from Milton; and he has shown — himself capable of producing as splendid verse.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_34_0	The capacity for assimilation, and the consequent extent of range, are conspicuous qualities of Dryden. He advanced and exhibited his variety by constant translation; and his translations of Horace, of Ovid, of Lucretius, are admirable. His gravest defects are supposed to be displayed in his dramas, but if these were more read they might be more praised. From the point of view of either the Elizabethan or the French drama they are obviously inferior ; but the charge of inferiority loses part of its force if we admit that Dryden was not quite trying to compete with either, but was pursuing a direction of his own. He created no character ; and although his arrangements of plot manifest exceptional ingenuity, it is the pure magnificence of diction, of poetic diction, that keeps his plays alive:—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_35_0	How I loved Witness ye days and nights, and all ye hours, That danced away with down upon your feet, As all your business were to count my passion. One day passed by, and nothing saw but love; Another came, and still ‘twas only love: The suns were wearied out with looking on, And I untired with loving, I saw you every day and all the day; And every day a as still but as the first: So eager was I Still to see you more...
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_36_0	While within your arms I lay, The world fell mould’ring from my hands each hour.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_37_0	Such language is pure Dryden: it sounds, in Mr. van Doren’s phrase, “like a gong.” All for Love, from which the lines are taken, is Dryden’s best play, and this is perhaps the highest reach. In general, he is best in his plays when dealing with situations which do not demand great emotional concentration ; when his situation is more trivial, and he can practise his art of making the small great. The back-talk between the Emperor and his Empress Nourmahal, in Aurungzebe is admirable purple comedy :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_38_0	Emperor: Such virtue is the plague of human life: a A virtuous woman, but a curséd wife. In vain of pompous chastity y’are proud: Virtue’s adultery of the tongue, when loud. I, with less pain, a prostitute could bear, Than the shrill sound of virtue, virtue hear. In unchaste wives— There’s yet a kind of recompensing ease: Vice keeps ’em humble, gives ’em care to please: But against clamourous virtue, what defede It stops our mouths, and gives your noise pretence. ...
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_39_0	What can be sweeter than our native home? Thither for ease, and soft repose, we come; Home is the sacred refuge of our life: Secure from all approaches but a wife If thence we fly, the cause admits no doubt: None but an inmate foe could force us out. Clamours, our privacies uneasy make: Birds leave their nests disturbed, and beasts their haunts forsake.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_40_0	But drama is a mixed form; pure magnificence will not carry it through. The poet who attempts to achieve a play by the single force of the word provokes comparison, however strictly he confine himself to his capacity, with poets of other gifts. Corneille and Racine do not attain their triumphs by magnificence of this sort; they have concentration also, and, in the midst of their phrases, an undisturbed attention to the human soul as they knew it.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_41_0	Nor is Dryden unchallenged in his supreme ability to make the ridiculous, or the trivial, great.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_42_0	Avez-vous observé que maints cercueils de vieilles Sont presque aussi petits que celui d’un enfant?
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_43_0	Those lines are the work of a man whose verse 1s as magnificent as Dryden’s, and who could see profounder possibilities in wit, and in violently joined images, than ever were in Dryden’s mind. For Dryden, with all his intellect, had a commonplace mind. His powers were, we believe, wider, but no greater, than Milton’s; he was confined by boundaries as impassable, though less strait. He bears a curious antithetical resemblance to Swinburne. Swinburne was also a master of words, but Swinburne’s words are all suggestions and no denotation; if they suggest nothing, it is because they suggest too much. Dryden’s words, on the other hand, are precise, they state immensely, but their suggestiveness is almost nothing.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_44_0	That short dark passage to a future state; The melancholy riddle of a breath, That something, or that nothing, after death.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_45_0	is a riddle, but not melancholy enough, in Dryden's splendid verse. The question, which has certainly been waiting, may justly be asked whether, without this which Dryden lacks, can verse can be poetry? What is He decide what poetry is?
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_46_0	Dryden’s use of language is not, like that of Swinburne, weakening and demoralizing. Let us take as a final test his elegy upon Oldham, which deserves not to be mutilated :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_47_0	Farewell, too little and too lately known, Whom I began to think and call my own; For sure our souls were near allied, and thine Cast in the same poetic mould with mine. One common note on either lyre did strike, And knaves and fools we both abhorred alike, To the same goal did both our studies drive; The last set out the soonest did arrive. Thus Nisus fell upon the slippery place, Whilst his young friend performed and won the race. O early ripe! to thy abundant store What could advancing age have added more? It might (what nature never gives the young) Have taught the numbers of thy native tongue. But satire needs not those, and wit will shine Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line. A noble error, and but seldom made, When poets are by too much force betrayed. Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime, Still showed a quickness; and maturing time But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of rhyme. Once more, hail, and farewell; farewell, thou young, But ah! too short, Marcellus of our tongue! Thy brows with ivy and with laurels bound; But fate and gloomy night encompass thee around.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_48_0	From the perfection of such an elegy we cannot detract; the lack of nebula is compensated by the satisfying completeness of the statement. Dryden lacked what his master Jonson possessed, a large and unique view of life; he lacked insight, he lacked profundity. But where Dryden fails to satisfy, the nineteenth century does not satisfy us either ; and where that century has condemned him, it is itself condemned. In the next revolution of taste it is possible that poets may turn to the study of Dryden. He remains one of those who have set standards for English yerse which it is desperate to ignore.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_49_0	II. THE METAPHYSICAL POETS
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_50_0	By collecting these poems from the work of a generation more often named than read, and more often read than profitably studied, Professor Grierson has rendered a service of some importance. Certainly the reader will meet with many poems already preserved in other anthologies, at the same time that he discovers poems such as those of Aurelian Townshend or Lord Herbert of Cherbury here included. But the function of such an anthology as this is neither that of Professor Saintsbury’s admirable edition of Caroline poets nor that of the “Oxford Book of English Verse.” Mr. Grierson’s book is in itself a piece of criticism, and a provocation of criticism; and we think that he was right in including so many poems of — Donne, elsewhere (though not in many editions) accessible, as documents in the case of “ metaphysical poetry.” The phrase — at has long done duty as a term of abuse, or as the label of a quaint and pleasant taste. The question is to what extent the so-called metaphysicals formed a school (in our own time we should say a movement), and how far this so-called school or movement is a digression from the main current. Not only is it extremely difficult to define metaphysical poetry, re but difficult to decide what poets practise it and in which of their verses. The poetry of Donne (to whom Marvell and Bishop King are sometimes nearer than any of the other authors) is late Elizabethan, its feeling often very
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_50_1	close to that of Chapman. The “ courtly ” poetry is derivative from Jonson, who borrowed liberally from the Latin; it expires in the next century with the sentiment and witticism of Prior. There is finally the devotional verse of Herbert, Vaughan, and Crashaw (echoed long after by Christina Rossetti and Francis Thompson); Crashaw, sometimes more profound and less sectarian than the others, has a quality which returns through the Elizabethan period to the early Italians. It is difficult to find any precise use of metaphor, simile, or other conceit, which is common to all the poets and at the same time important enough as an element of style to isolate these poets as a group. Donne, and often Cowley, employ a device which is sometimes considered characteristically “metaphysical”; the elaboration (contrasted with the condensation) of a figure of speech to the farthest stage to which ingenuity can carry it. Thus Cowley develops the commonplace comparison of the world to a chess-board through long stanzas (“To Destiny”), and Donne, with more grace, in “ A Valediction,” the comparison of two lovers to a pair of compasses. But elsewhere we find, instead of the mere explication of the content of a comparison, a development by rapid association of thought which requires considerable agility on the part of the reader.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_51_0	On a round ball A workeman that hath copies by, can lay An Europe, Afrique, and an Asia, And quickly make that, which was nothing, All, So doth each teare, Which thee doth weare, A globe, yea world by that impression grow, Till thy tears mixt with mine doe overflow This world, by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_52_0	Here we find at least two connexions which are not implicit in the first figure, but are forced upon it by the poet: from the geographer’s globe to the tear, and the tear to the deluge. On the other hand, some of Donne’s most successful and characteristic effects are secured by brief words and sudden contrasts—-
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_53_0	A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_54_0	where the most powerful effect is produced by the sudden contrast of associations of “bright hair” and of “bone.” This telescoping of images and multiplied association is characteristic of the phrase of some of the dramatists of the period which Donne knew: not to mention Shakespeare, it is frequent in Middleton, Webster, and Tourneur, and is one of the sources of the vitality of their language.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_55_0	Johnson, who employed the term “ metaphysical poets,” apparently having Donne, Cleveland, and Cowley chiefly in mind, remarks of them that “the most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together.” The force of this impeachment lies in the failure of the conjunction, the fact that often the ideas are yoked but not united; and if we are to judge of styles of poetry by their abuse, enough examples may be found in Cleveland to justify Johnson’s condemnation. But a degree of heterogeneity of material compelled into unity by the operation of the poet's mind is omnipresent in poetry. We need not select for illustration such a line as—

1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_57_0	we may find it in some of the best lines of Johnson himself (“The Vanity of Human Wishes):--
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_58_0	His fate was destined to a barren strand, A petty fortress, and a dubious hand; He left a name at which the world grew pale, To point a moral, or adorn a tale,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_59_0	where the effect is due to a contrast of ideas, different in degree but the same in principle, as that which Johnson mildly reprehended. And in one of the finest poems of the age (a poem which could not have been written in any other age), the “Exequy” of Bishop King, the extended comparison is used with perfect success: the idea and the simile become one, in the passage in which the Bishop illustrates his impatience to see his dead wife, under the figure of a journey :-—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_60_0	Stay for me there; I will not faile To meet thee in that hollow Vale. And think not much of my delay; I am already on the way, And follow thee with all the speed Desire can make, or sorrows breed. Each minute is a short degree, And ev'ry houre a step towards thee. At night when I betake to rest, Next morn I rise nearer my West Of life, almost by eight houres sail, Than when sleep breath’d his drowsy Gales But heark! My Pulse, like a soft Drum Beats my approach, tells Thee I come; And slow howere my marches be, I shall at last sit down by Thee.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_61_0	(In the last few lines there is that effect of terror which is several times attained by one of Bishop King’s admirers, Edgar Poe.) Again, we may justly take these quatrains from Lord Herbert’s Ode, stanzas which would, we think, be immediately pronounced to be of the metaphysical school :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_62_0	So when from hence we shall be gone, And be no more, nor you, nor I, As one another’s mystery, Each shall be both, yet both but one. :
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_63_0	This said, in her up-lifted face, Her eyes, which did that beauty crown, Were like two starrs, that having faln down, Look up again to find their place:
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_64_0	While such a moveless silent peace Did seize on their becalmed sense, lo’ One would have thought some influence Their ravished spirits did possess.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_65_0	There is nothing in these lines (with the possible exception of the stars, a simile not at once grasped, but lovely and justified) which fits Johnson’s general observations on the metaphysical poets in his essay on Cowley. A good deal resides in the richness of association which is at the same time borrowed from and given to the word “becalmed’”’; but the meaning is clear, the language simple and elegant. It is to be observed that the language of these poets is as a rule simple and pure; in the verse of George Herbert this simplicity is carried as far as it can go — a simplicity emulated without success by numerous modern poets. The structure of the sentences, on the other hand, is sometimes far from simple, but this is not a vice; it is a fidelity to thought and feeling. The effect, at its best, is far less artificial than that of an ode by Gray. And as this fidelity induces variety of thought and feeling, so it induces variety of music. We doubt whether, in the eighteenth century, could be found two poems in nominally the same metre, so dissimilar as Marvell’s “ Coy Mistress’ and Crashaw’s “ Saint Teresa”; the one producing an effect of great speed by the use of short syllables, and the other an ecclesiastical solemnity by the use of long ones :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_66_0	Love, thou art absolute sole lord Of life and death.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_67_0	If so shrewd and sensitive (though so limited) a critic as Johnson failed to define metaphysical poetry by its faults, it is worth while to inquire whether we may not have more success by adopting the opposite method: by assuming that the poets of the seventeenth century (up to the Revolution) were the direct and normal development of the precedent age; and, without prejudicing their case by the adjective “ metaphysical,” consider whether their virtue was not something permanently valuable, which subsequently disappeared, but ought not to have disappeared. Johnson has hit, perhaps by accident, on one of their peculiarities, when he observes that “their attempts were always analytic”; he would not agree that, after the dissociation, they put the material together again in a new unity.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_68_0	It is certain that the dramatic verse of the later Elizabethan and early Jacobean poets expresses a degree of development of sensibility which is not found in any of the prose, good as it often is. If we except Marlowe, a man of prodigious intelligence, these dramatists were directly or indirectly (it is at least a tenable theory) affected by Montaigne. Even if we except also Jonson and Chapman, these two were notably erudite, and were notably men who incorporated their erudition into their sensibility: their mode of feeling was directly and freshly altered by their reading and thought. In Chapman especially there is a direct sensuous apprehension of thought, or a re creation of thought into feeling, which is exactly what we find in Donne :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_69_0	in this one thing, all the discipline Of manners and of manhood is contained; A man to join himself with th’ Universe In his main sway, and make in all things fit One with that All, and go on, round as it; Not plucking from the whole his wretched part, And into straits, or into nought revert, Wishing the complete Universe might be Subject ‘to such a rag of it as he; But to consider great Necessity.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_70_0	We compare this with some modern passage :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_71_0	No, when the fight begins within himself, A man’s worth something. God stoops o’er his head, Satan looks up between his feet—both tug— He’s left, himself, i' the middle; the soul wakes And grows. Prolong that battle through his life!
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_72_0	It is perhaps somewhat less fair, though very tempting (as both poets are concerned with the perpetuation of love by offspring), to compare with the stanzas already quoted from Lord Herbert’s Ode the following from Tennyson :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_73_0	One walked between his wife and child, With measured footfall firm and mild, And now and then he gravely smiled. The prudent partner of his blood Leaned on him, faithful, gentle, good, Wearing the rose of womanhood. And in their double love secure. The little maiden walked demure, Pacing with downward eyelids pure. These three made unity so sweet, My frozen heart began to beat, Remembering its ancient heat.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_74_0	The difference is not a simple difference of degree between poets. It is something which had happened to the mind of England between the time of Donne or Lord Herbert of Cherbury and the time of Tennyson and Browning; it is the difference between the intellectual poet and the reflective poet, Tennyson and Browning are poets, and they think; but they do not feel their thought as immediately as the odour of a rose. A thought to Donne was an experience ; it modified his sensibility. When a poet's mind is perfectly equipped for its work, it is constantly amalgamating disparate experience ; the ordinary man’s experience is chaotic, irregular, fragmentary. The latter falls in love, or reads Spinoza, and these two experiences have nothing to do with each other, or with the noise of the typewriter or the smell of cooking; in the mind of the poet these experiences are always forming new wholes.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_75_0	We may express the difference by the following theory:— The poets of the seventeenth century, the successors of the dramatists of the sixteenth, possessed a mechanism of sensibility which could devour any kind of experience. They are simple, artificial, difficult, or fantastic, as their predecessors were; no less nor more than Dante, Guido Cavalcanti, Guinizelli, or Cino. In the seventeenth century a dissociation of sensibility set in, from which we have never recovered; and this dissociation, as is natural, was due to the influence of the two most powerful poets of the century, Milton and Dryden. Each of these men performed certain poetic functions so magnificently well that the magnitude of the effect concealed the absence of others. The language went on and in some respects improved; the best verse of Collins, Gray, Johnson, and even Goldsmith satisfies some of our fastidious demands better than that of Donne or Marvell or King. But while the language became more refined, the feeling became more crude. The feeling, the sensibility, expressed in the “Country Churchyard” (to say nothing of Tennyson and Browning) is cruder than that in the “‘ Coy Mistress.”
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_76_0	The second effect of the influence of Milton and Dryden followed from the first, and was therefore slow in manifestation. The sentimental age began early in the eighteenth century, and continued. The poets revolted against the ratiocinative, the descriptive; they thought and felt by fits, unbalanced ; they reflected. In one or two passages of Shelley's “ Triumph of Life,” in the second “ Hyperion,” there are traces of a struggle toward unification of sensibility. But Keats and Shelley died, and Tennyson and Browning rutminated.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_77_0	After this brief exposition of a theory — too brief, perhaps, to carry conviction — we may ask, what would have been the fate of the “metaphysical” had the current of poetry descended in a direct line from them, as it descended in a direct line to them? They would not, certainly, be classified as metaphysical. The possible interests of a poet are unlimited; the more intelligent he is the better; the more intelligent he is the more likely that he will have interests: our only condition is that he turn them into poetry, and not merely meditate on them poetically. A philosophical theory which has entered into poetry is established, for its truth or falsity in one sense ceases to matter, and its truth in another sense is proved. The poets in question have, like other poets, various. faults. But they were, at best, engaged in the task of trying to find the verbal equivalent for states of mind and feeling. And this means both that they are more mature, and that they wear. better, than later poets of certainly not less literary ability.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_78_0	It is not a permanent necessity that poets should be interested in philosophy, or in any other subject. We can only say that it appears likely that poets in our civilization, as it exists at present, must be difficult. Our civilization comprehends great variety and complexity, and this variety and complexity, playing upon a refined sensibility, must produce various and complex results. The poet must become more and more comprehensive, more allusive, more indirect, in order to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning. (A brilliant and extreme statement of this view, with which it is not requisite to associate oneself, is that of M. Jean Epstein, “ La Poésie d’aujourd-hui.”) Hence we get something which looks very much like the conceit - we get, in fact, a method curiously similar to that of the “metaphysical poets,” similar also in its use of obscure words and of simple phrasing.

1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_82_0	Jules Laforgue, and Tristan Corbiére in many of his poems, are nearer to the “ school of Donne ” than any modern English poet. But poets more classical than they have the same essential quality of transmuting ideas into sensations, of transforming an observation into a state of mind.

1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_84_0	In French literature the great master of the seventeenth century - Racine — and the great master of the nineteenth — Baudelaire — are more like each other than they are like anyone else. The greatest two masters of diction are also the greatest two psychologists, the most curious explorers of the soul. It is interesting to speculate whether it is not a misfortune that two of the greatest masters of diction in our language, Milton and Dryden, triumph with a dazzling disregard of the soul. If we continued to produce Miltons and Drydens it might not so much matter, but as things are it is a pity that English poetry has remained so incomplete. Those who object to the “ artificiality” of Milton or Dryden sometimes tell us to “look into our hearts and write.” But that is not looking deep enough; Racine or Donne looked into a good deal more than the heart. One must look into the cerebral cortex, the nervous system, and the digestive tracts.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_85_0	May we not conclude, then, that Donne, Crashaw, Vaughan, Herbert and Lord Herbert, Marvell, King, Cowley at his best, are in the direct current of English poetry, and that their faults should be reprimanded by this standard rather than coddled by antiquarian affection? They have been enough praised in terms which are implicit limitations because they are “metaphysical ” or witty,” “quaint” or “ obscure,” though at their best they have not these attributes more than other serious poets. On the other hand, we must not reject the criticism of Johnson (a dangerous person to disagree with) without having mastered it, without having assimilated the Johnsonian canons of taste. In reading the celebrated passage in his essay on Cowley we must remember that by wit he clearly means something more serious than we usually mean to-day; in his criticism of their versification we must remember in what a narrow discipline he was trained, but also how well trained; we must remember that Johnson tortures chiefly the chief offenders, Cowley and Cleveland. It would be a fruitful work, and one requiring a substantial book, to break up the classification of Johnson (for there has been none since) and exhibit these poets in all their difference of kind and of degree, from the massive music of Donne to the faint, pleasing tinkle of Aurelian Townshend— whose “ Dialogue between a Pilgrim and Time” is one of the few regrettable omissions from this excellent anthology. III. ANDREW MARVELL
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_86_0	The tercentenary of the former member for Hull deserves not only the celebration proposed by that favoured borough, but a little serious reflection upon his writing. That is an act of piety, which is very different from the resurrection of a deceased reputation, Marvell has stood high for some years; his best poems are not very many, and not only must be well known, from the “ Golden Treasury ” and the “ Oxford Book of English Verse,” but must also have been enjoyed by numerous readers. His grave needs neither rose nor rue nor laurel; there is no imaginary justice to be done; we may think about him, if there be need for thinking, for our own benefit, not his. To bring the poet back to life—the great, the perennial, task of criticism—is in this case to squeeze the drops of the essence of two or three poems; even confining ourselves to these, we may find some precious liquor unknown to the present age. Not to determine rank, but to isolate this quality, is the critical labour. The fact that of all Marvell’s verse, which is itself not a great quantity, the really valuable part consists of | a very few poems indicates that the unknown quality of which we speak is probably a literary rather than a personal q it or, more truly, that it is a quality of a civilization, of a traditional habit of life. A poet like Donne, or like Baudelaire or Laforgue, may almost
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_86_1	be considered the inventor of an attitude, — a system of feeling or of morals. Donne is difficult to analyse: what appears at one time a curious personal point of view may at another time appear rather the precise concentration of a kind of feeling diffused in the air about him. Donne and his shroud, the shroud and his motive for wearing it, are inseparable, but they are not the same thing. The seventeenth century sometimes seems for more than a moment to gather up and to digest into its art all the experience of the human mind which (from the same point of view) the later centuries seem to have been partly engaged in repudiating. But Donne would have been an individual at any time and place; Marvell's best verse is the product of European, that is to say Latin, culture.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_87_0	Out of that high style developed from Marlowe through Jonson (for Shakespeare does not lend himself to these genealogies) the seventeenth century separated two qualities: wit and magniloquence. Neither is as simple or as apprehensible as its name seems to imply, and the two are not in practice antithetical; both are conscious and cultivated, and the mind which cultivates one may cultivate the other. The actual poetry, of Marvell, of Cowley, of Milton, and of others, is a blend in varying proportions. And we must be on guard not to employ the terms with too wide a comprehension; for like the other fluid terms with which literary criticism deals, the meaning alters with the age, and for precision we must rely to some degree upon the literacy and good taste of the reader. The wit of the Caroline poets is not the wit of Shakespeare, and it is not the wit of Dryden, the great master of contempt, or of Pope, the great master of hatred, or of Swift, the great master of disgust. What is meant is something which is a common quality to the songs in “‘Comus ” and Cowley’s Anacreontics and Marvell’s Horatian Ode. It is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch ; it is, what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace. You cannot find it in Shelley or Keats or Wordsworth; you cannot find more than an echo of it in
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_87_1	Landor; still less in Tennyson or Browning; and among contemporaries Mr. Yeats is an Irishman and Mr. Hardy is a modern Englishman—that is to say, Mr. Hardy is without it and Mr. Yeats is outside of the tradition altogether. On the other hand, as it certainly exists in Lafontaine, there is a large part of it in Gautier. And of the magniloquence, the deliberate exploitation of the possibilities of magnificence in language which Milton used and abused, there is also use and even abuse in the poetry of Baudelaire.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_88_0	Wit is not a quality that we are accustomed to associate with “ Puritan” literature, with Milton or with Marvell. But if so, we are at fault partly in our conception of wit and partly in our generalizations about the Puritans. And if the wit of Dryer or of Pope is not the only kind of wit in the language, the er is not merely a little merriment or a little levity or a little impropriety or a little epigram. And, on the other hand, the sense in which a man like Marvell is a “ Puritan ” is restricted. The persons who opposed Charles I. and the persons who supported the Commonwealth were not all of the flock of Rabbi Zeal-of-the-land Busy or the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association. Many of them were gentlemen of the time who merely believed, with considerable show of reason, that government by a Parliament of gentlemen was better than government by a Stuart; though they were, to that extent, Liberal Practitioners, they could hardly foresee the tea-meeting and the Dissidence of Dissent. Being men of education and culture, even of:travel, some of them were exposed to that spirit of the age which was coming to be the French spirit of the age. This spirit, curiously enough, was quite opposed to the tendencies latent or the forces active in Puritanism; the contest does great damage to the poetry of Milton; Marvell, an active servant of the public, but a lukewarm partisan, and a
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_88_1	poet on a smaller scale, is far less injured by it. His line on the statue of Charles II., “It is such a King as no chisel can mend,” may be set off against his criticism of the Great Rebellion: “Men... ought and might have trusted the King.” Marvell, therefore, more a man of the century than a Puritan, speaks more clearly and unequivocally with the voice of his literary age than does Milton.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_89_0	"This voice speaks out uncommonly strong in the “Coy Mistress” The theme is one of the great traditional common| places of European literature. It is the theme of “O mistress mine"" of ""Gather ye rosebuds"" of ""Go, lovely rose""; it is in the savage austerity of Lucretius and the intense levity of Catullus. Where the wit of Marvell renews the theme is in the variety and order of the images. In the first of the three paragraphs Marvell plays with a fancy which begins by pleasing and leads to astonishment."
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_90_0	Had we but world enough and time, This coyness, lady, were no crime, ... I would Love you ten years before the Flood, And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews; My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires and more slow. ...
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_91_0	We notice the high speed, the succession of concentrated images, each magnifying the original fancy. When this process has been carried to the end and summed up, the poem turns suddenly with that surprise which has been one of the most important means of poetic effect since Homer :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_92_0	But at my back I always hear Time’s wingéd chariot hurrying near, And yonder all before us lie Deserts of vast eternity.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_93_0	A whole civilization resides in these lines :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_94_0	Pallida Mors equa pulsat pede pauperump tabernas, Regumque turris. ...
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_95_0	And not only Horace but Catullus himself :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_96_0	Nobis, cum semel occidit brevis lux, Nox est perpetua una dormienda.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_97_0	The verse of Marvell has not the grand reverberation of Catullus’s Latin; but the image of Marvell is certainly more comprehensive and penetrates greater depths than Horace’s. A modern poet, had he reached the height, would very likely have closed on this moral reflection. But the three strophes of Marvell’s poem have something like a syllogistic relation of each other. After a close approach to the mood of Donne,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_98_0	then worms shall try That long-preserved virginity ... The grave’s a fine and private place, But none, I think, do there embrace,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_99_0	the conclusion,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_100_0	Let us roll all our strength and all Our sweetness up into one ball, And tear our pleasures with rough strife, Through the iron gates of life.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_101_0	It will hardly be denied that this poem contains wit; but it may not be evident that this wit forms the crescendo and diminuendo of a scale of great imaginative power. The wit is not only combined with, but fused into, the imagination. We can easily recognize a witty fancy in the successive images hi (“my vegetable love,” “till the conversion of the Jews”’), but this fancy is not indulged, as it sometimes is by Cowley or Cleveland, for its own sake. It is structural decoration of
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_102_0	a serious idea. In this it is superior to the fancy of “ L’Allegro,” “Il Penseroso,” or the lighter and less successful poems of Keats. In fact, this alliance of levity and seriousness (by which the seriousness is intensified) is a characteristic of the sort of wit we are trying to identify. It is found in
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_103_0	Le squelette était invisible Au temps heureux de l'art paien!
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_104_0	of Gautier, and in the dandysme of Baudelaire and Laforgue. It is in the poem of Catullus which has been quoted, and in the variation by Ben Jonson :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_105_0	Cannot we deceive the eyes Of a few poor household spies? ’Tis no sin love's fruits to steal, But that sweet sin to reveal, To be taken, to be seen, These have sins accounted been.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_106_0	It is in Propertius and Ovid. It is a quality of a sophisticated literature; a quality which expands in English literature just at the moment before the English mind altered; it is not a quality which we should expect Puritanism to encourage. When we come to Gray and Collins, the sophistication remains only in the language, and has disappeared from the feeling. Gray and Collins were masters, but they had lost that hold on human values, that firm grasp of human experience, which is a formidable achievement of the Elizabethan and Jacobean poets. This wisdom, cynical perhaps but untired (in Shakespeare, a terrifying clairvoyance), leads toward, and is only completed by, the religious comprehension; it leads to the point of the Ainsi tout leur a craqué dans la main of Bouvard and Pécuchet.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_107_0	The difference between imagination and fancy, in view of this poetry of wit, is a very narrow one. Obviously, an image which is immediately and unintentionally ridiculous is merely a fancy. In the poem “Upon Appleton House,” Marvell falls in with one of these undesirable images, describing the attitude of the house toward its master :-—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_108_0	Yet thus the laden house does sweat, And scarce endures the master great; But, where he comes, the swelling hall Stirs, and the square grows spherical ;
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_109_0	which, whatever its intention, is more absurd than it was intended to be. Marvell also falls into the even commoner error of images which are over-developed or distracting ; which support nothing but their own misshapen bodies :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_110_0	And now the salmon-fishers moist Their leathern boats begin to hoist; And, like Antipodes in shoes, Have shod their heads in their canoes.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_111_0	Of this sort of image a choice collection may be found in Johnson’s “Life of Cowley.” But the images in the “ Coy Mistress” are not only witty, but satisfy the elucidation of Imagination given by Coleridge :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_112_0	“This power . . . reveals itself in the balance or reconcile ment of opposite or discordant qualities: of sameness, with difference; of the general, with the concrete; the idea with the image; the individual with the representative; the sense of novelty and freshness with old and familiar objects; a more than usual state of emotion with more than usual order; judgment ever awake and steady self-possession with enthusiasm and feeling profound or vehement. . . .”
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_113_0	Coleridge’s statement applies also to the following verses, which are selected because of their similarity, and because they illustrate the marked caesura which Marvell often introduces in a short line :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_114_0	The tawny mowers enter next, Who seem like Israelites to be Walking on foot through a green sea,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_115_0	And now the meadows fresher dyed, Whose grass, with moister colour dashed, Seems as green silks but newly washed.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_116_0	He hangs in shades the orange bright, Like golden lamps in a green night.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_117_0	Annihilating all that’s made To a green thought in a green shade.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_118_0	Had it lived long, it would have been . Lilies without, roses within.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_119_0	The whole poem, from which the last of these quotations is
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_120_0	drawn (“The Nymph and the Fawn”’), is built upon a very slight foundation, and we can imagine what some of our modern practitioners of slight themes would have made of it. But we need not descend to an invidious contemporaneity _ to point the difference. Here are six lines from “The Nymph and the Fawn ” :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_121_0	I have a garden of my own, But so with roses overgrown And lilies, that you would it guess To be a little wilderness; And all the ‘spring-time of the wear 2: =e It only lovéd to be there.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_122_0	And here are five lines from “The Nymph’s Song to Hylas ” in the “Life and Death of Jason,” by William Morris :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_123_0	T know a little garden close Set thick with lily and red rose. Where I would wander if I might From dewy dawn to dewy night, And have one with me wandering.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_124_0	So far the resemblance is more striking than the difference, although we might just notice the vagueness of allusion in the last line to some indefinite person, form, or phantom, compared with the more explicit reference of emotion to object which we should expect from Marvell. But in the latter part of the poem Morris divaricates widely :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_125_0	Yet tottering as I am, and weak, Still have I left a little breath To seek within the jaws of death An entrance to that happy place;
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_126_0	To seek the unforgotten face Once seen, once kissed, once reft from me Anigh the murmuring of the sea.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_127_0	Here the resemblance, if there is any, is to the latter part of “The Coy Mistress.” As for the difference, it could not be more pronounced. The effect of Morris's charming poem depends upon the mistiness of the feeling and the vagueness of its object; the effect of Marvell’s upon its bright, hard precision. And this precision is not due to the fact that Marvell is concerned with cruder or simpler or more carnal emotions. The emotion of Morris is not more refined or more spiritual; it is merely more vague: if anyone doubts whether the more refined or spiritual emotion can be precise, he should study the treatment of the varieties of discarnate emotion in the “Paradiso.” A curious result of the comparison of Morris’s poem with Marvell’s is that the former, though it appears to be more serious, is found to be the slighter; and Marvell’s “ Nymph and the Fawn,” appearing more slight, is the more serious.

1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_129_0	These verses have the suggestiveness of trite poetry ; verses of Morris, which are nothing if not an attempt to suggest, really suggest nothing; and we are inclined to infer that the suggestiveness is the aura around a bright clear centre that you cannot have the aura alone. The day-dreamy feeling of Morris is essentially a slight thing; Marvell takes a slight affair the feeling of a girl for her pet, and gives it a connexion with that inexhaustible and terrible nebula of emotion which surrounds all our exact and practical passions and mingles with them. Again, Marvell does this in a poem which, because of its formal pastoral machinery, may appear a trifling object :—

1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_133_0	where we find that a metaphor has suddenly rapt us to the image of spiritual purgation. There is here the element of surprise, as when Villon says :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_134_0	Necessité faict gens mesprendre Et faim saillir le loup des boys,
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_135_0	the surprise which Poe considered of the highest importance, — and also the restraint and quietness of tone which make the — surprise possible. And in the verses of Marvell which have — been quoted there is the making the familiar strange, and the strange familiar, which Coleridge attributed to good poetry. — The effort to construct a dream-world, which alters English poetry so greatly in the nineteenth century, a dream-world utterly different from the visionary realities of the Vita Nuova, or of the poetry of Dante’s contemporaries, is a problem of which various explanations may no doubt be found; in any case, the result makes a poet of the nineteenth century, of the same size as Marvell, a more trivial and less serious figure. Marvell is no greater personality than William Morris, but he had something much more solid behind him: he had the vast and penetrating influence of Ben Jonson. Jonson never wrote anything so pure as Marvell’s Horatian Ode; but this ode has that same quality of wit which was diffused over the whole Elizabethan product and concentrated in the work of Jonson. And, as was said before, this wit which pervades the poetry of Marvell is more Latin, more refined, than anything that succeeded it. The great danger, as well as the great interest and excitement, of English prose and verse, compared with French, is that it permits and justifies an exaggeration of particular qualities to the exclusion of others. Dryden was great in wit, as
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_135_1	Milton in magniloquence; but the former, by isolating this quality and making it by itself into great poetry, and the latter, by coming to dispense with it altogether, may perhaps have injured the language. In Dryden wit becomes almost fun, and thereby loses some contact with reality; becomes pure fun, which French wit almost never is.

1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_145_0	There is here an equipoise, a balance and proportion of tones, which, while it cannot raise Marvell to the level of Dryden or Milton, extorts an approval which these poets do not receive from us, and bestows a pleasure at least different in kind from any they can often give. It is what makes Marvell a Classic; or classic in a sense in which Gray and Collins are not; for the latter, with all their accredited purity, are comparatively poor in shades of feeling to contrast and unite.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_146_0	We are baffled in the attempt to translate the quality indicated by the dim and antiquated term wit into the equally unsatisfactory nomenclature of our own time. Even Cowley is only able to define it by negatives :—
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_147_0	Comely in thousand shapes appears; Yonder we saw it plain; and here ’tis now, Like spirits in a place, we know not how.
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_148_0	"It has passed out of our critical coinage altogether, and no new term has been struck to replace it; the quality seldom exists, and is never recognized. So far Cowley has spoken well. But if we are to attempt even no more than Cowley, we, placed in a retrospective attitude, must risk much more than anxious generalizations. With our eye still on Marvell, we can say that wit is not erudition; it is sometimes stifled by erudition, as in much of Milton. It is not cynicism, though it has a kind of toughness which may be confused with cynicism by the tender-minded. It is confused with erudition becatise it belongs to an educated mind, rich in generations of experience; and it is confused with cynicism because it implies a constant inspection and criticism of experience. It involves, probably, a recognition, implicit in the expression of every experience, of other kinds of experience which are possible, which we find as clearly in the greatest as in poets like Marvell. Such a general statement may. seem to take us a long way from ""The Nymph and the Fawn,” or even from the Horatian Ode; but it is perhaps justified by the desire to account for that precise taste of Marvell’s which finds for him the proper degree of seriousness for every subject which he treats. His errors of taste, when he trespasses, are not sins against this virtue; they are conceits, distended metaphors and similes, but they never consist in taking a"
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_148_1	subject too seriously or too lightly. This virtue of wit is not a peculiar quality of minor poets, or of the minor poets of one age or of one school; it is an intellectual quality which perhaps only becomes noticeable by itself, in the work of lesser poets. Furthermore, it is absent from the work of Wordsworth, Shelley, and Keats, on whose poetry nineteenth-century criticism has unconsciously been based. To the best of their poetry wit is irrelevant:--
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_149_0	Art thou pale for weariness Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth, Wandering companionless Among the stars that have a different birth, And ever changing, like a joyless eye, That finds no object worth its constancy?
1-4-homage-dryden	doc_21_150_0	We should find it difficult to draw any useful comparison between these lines of Shelley and anything by Marvell, But later poets, who would have been the better for Marvell's quality, were without it; even Browning seems oddly immature, in some way, beside Marvell. And nowadays we find occasionally good irony, or satire, which lack wit’s internal equilibrium, because their voices are essentially protests against some outside sentimentality or stupidity; or we find serious poets who are afraid of acquiring wit, lest they lose intensity, The quality which Marvell had, this modest and certainly impersonal virtue — whether we call it wit or reason, or even urbanity — we have patently failed to define. By whatever name we call it, and however we define that name, it is something precious and needed and apparently extinct; it is what should preserve the reputation of Marvell. C’était une belle dame, comme on ne fait plus a Londres.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_0_0	"It seems to me possible, perhaps desirable, that I may be the only person in this room who has committed the folly of writing, trying to write, or failing to write, a novel. And when I asked myself, as your invitation to speak to you about modern fiction made me ask myself, what demon whispered in my ear and urged me to my doom, a little figure rose before me the figure of a man, or of a woman, who said, ""My name is Brown. Catch me if you can."""
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_1_0	"Most novelists have the same experience. Some Brown, Smith, or Jones comes before them and says in the most seductive and charming way in the world, ""Come and catch me if you can."" And so, led on by this will-o'the-wisp, they flounder through volume after volume, spending the best years of their lives in the pursuit, and receiving for the most part very little cash in exchange. Few catch the phantom; most have to be content with a scrap of her dress or a wisp of her hair."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_2_0	"My belief that men and women write novels because they are lured on to create some character which has thus imposed itself upon them has the sanction of Mr. Arnold Bennett. In an article from which I will quote he says: ""The foundation of good fiction is character-creating and nothing else.... Style counts; plot counts ; originality of outlook counts. But none of these counts anything like so much as the convincingness of the characters. If the characters are real the novel will have a chance; if they are not, oblivion will be its portion. ..."" And he goes on to draw the conclusion that we have no young novelists of first-rate importance at the present moment, because they are unable to create characters that are real, true, and convincing."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_3_0	"These are the questions that I want with greater boldness than discretion to discuss to-night. I want to make out what we mean when we talk about ""character"" in fiction ; to say something about the question of reality which Mr. Bennett raises ; and to suggest some reasons why the younger novelists fail to create characters, if, as Mr. Bennett asserts, it is true that fail they do. This will lead me, I am well aware, to make some very sweeping and some very vague assertions. For the question is an extremely difficult one. Think how little we know about character think how little we know about art. But, to make a clearance before I begin, I will suggest that we range Edwardians and Georgians into two camps; Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy I will call the Edwardians ; Mr. Forster, Mr. Lawrence, Mr. Strachey, Mr. Joyce, and Mr. Eliot I will call the Georgians. And if I speak in the first person, with intolerable egotism, I will ask you to excuse me. I do not want to attribute to the world at large the opinions of one solitary, ill-informed, and misguided individual."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_4_0	My first assertion is one that I think you will grant that every one in this room is a judge of character. Indeed it would be impossible to live for a year without disaster unless one practised character-reading and had some skill in the art. Our marriages, our friendships depend on it; our business largely depends on it; every day questions arise which can only be solved by its help. And now I will hazard a second assertion, which is more disputable perhaps, to the effect that on or about December 1910 human character changed.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_5_0	I am not saying that one went out, as one might into a garden and there saw that a rose had flowered, or that a hen had laid an egg. The change was not sudden and definite like that. But a change there was, nevertheless ; and, since one must arbitrary, let us date it about the year 1910. The first signs of it are recorded in the books of Samuel Butler, in The Way of All Flesh in particular ; the plays of Bernard Shaw continue to record it. In life one can see the change, if I may use a homely illustration, in the character of one's cook. The Victorian cook lived like a leviathan in the lower depths, formidable, silent, obscure, inscrutable; the Georgian cook is a creature of sunshine and fresh air; in and out of the drawing-room, now to borrow The Daily Herald, now to ask advice about a hat. Do you ask for more solemn instances of the power of the human race to change? Read the Agamemnon, and see whether, in process of time, your sympathies are not almost entirely with Clytemnestra. Or consider the married life of the Carlyles, and bewail the waste, the futility, for him and for her, of the horrible domestic tradition which made it seemly for a woman of genius to spend her time chasing beetles, scouring saucepans, instead of writing books. All human relations have shifted those between masters and servants, husbands and wives, parents and children.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_5_1	And when human relations change there is at the same time a change in religion, conduct, politics, and literature. Let us agree to place one of these changes about the year 1910.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_6_0	I have said that people have to acquire a good deal of skill in character-reading if they are to live a single year of life without disaster. But it is the art of the young. In middle age and in old age the art is practised mostly for its uses, and friendships and other adventures and experiments in the art of reading character are seldom made. But novelists differ from the rest of the world because they do not cease to be interested in character when they have learnt enough about it for practical purposes. They go a step further ; they feel that there is something permanently interesting in character in itself. When all the practical business of life has been discharged, there is something about people which continues to seem to them of overwhelming importance, in spite of the fact that it has no bearing whatever upon their happiness, comfort, or income. The study of character becomes to them an absorbing pursuit; to impart character an obsession. And this I find it very difficult to explain: what novelists mean when they talk about character, what the impulse is that urges them so powerfully every now and then to embody their view in writing.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_7_0	So, if you will allow me, instead of analysing and abstracting, I will tell you a simple story which, however pointless, has the merit of being true, of a journey from Richmond to Waterloo, in the hope that I may show you what I mean by character in itself ; that you may realise the different aspects it can wear; and the hideous perils that beset you directly you try to describe it in words.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_8_0	One night some weeks ago, then, I was late for the train and jumped into the first carriage I came to. As I sat down I had the strange and uncomfortable feeling that I was interrupting a conversation between two people who were already sitting there. Not that they were young or happy. Far from it. They were both elderly, the woman over sixty, the man well over forty. They were sitting opposite each other, and the man, who had been leaning over and talking emphatically to judge by his attitude and the flush on his face, sat back and became silent. I had disturbed him, and he was annoyed. The elderly lady, however, whom I will call Mrs. Brown, seemed rather relieved. She was one of those clean, threadbare old ladies whose extreme tidiness everything buttoned, fastened, tied together, mended and brushed up suggests more extreme poverty than rags and dirt. There was something pinched about her a look of suffering, of apprehension, and, in addition, she was extremely small. Her feet, in their clean little boots, scarcely touched the floor. I felt that she had nobody to support her; that she had to make up her mind for herself; that, having been deserted, or left a widow, years ago, she had led an anxious, harried life, bringing up an only son, perhaps, who, as likely as not, was by this time beginning to go to the bad. All this shot through my mind as I sat down, being
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_8_1	uncomfortable, like most people, at travelling with fellow passengers unless I have somehow or other accounted for them. Then I looked at the man. He was no relation of Mrs, Brown's I felt sure ; he was of a bigger, burlier, less refined type. He was a man of business I imagined, very likely a respectable corn-chandler from the North, dressed in good blue serge with a pocket-knife and a silk handkerchief, and a stout leather bag. Obviously, however, he had an unpleasant business to settle with Mrs. Brown; a secret, perhaps sinister business, which they did not intend to discuss in my presence.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_9_0	"""Yes, the Crofts have had very bad luck with their servants,"" Mr. Smith (as I will call him) said in a considering way, going back to some earlier topic, with a view to keeping up appearances."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_10_0	"""Ah, poor people,"" said Mrs. Brown, a trifle condescendingly. “My grandmother had a maid who came when she was fifteen and stayed till she was eighty"" (this was said with a kind of hurt and aggressive pride to impress us both perhaps)."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_11_0	"""One doesn't often come across that sort of thing nowadays,"" said Mr. Smith in conciliatory tones."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_12_0	Then they were silent.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_13_0	"""It's odd they don't start a golf club there I should have thought one of the young fellows would,"" said Mr. Smith, for the silence obviously made him uneasy."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_14_0	Mrs. Brown hardly took the trouble to answer.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_15_0	"""What changes they're making in this part of the world,"" said Mr. Smith looking out of the window, and looking furtively at me as he did do."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_16_0	It was plain, from Mrs. Brown's silence, from the uneasy affability with which Mr. Smith spoke, that he had some power over her which he was exerting disagreeably. It might have been her son's downfall, or some painful episode in her past life, or her daughter's. Perhaps she was going to London to sign some document. to make over some property. Obviously against her will she was in Mr. Smith's hands. I was beginning to feel a great deal of pity for her, when she said, suddenly and inconsequently,
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_17_0	"""Can you tell me if an oak-tree dies when the leaves have been eaten for two years in succession by caterpillars?"""
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_18_0	She spoke quite brightly, and rather precisely, in a cultivated, inquisitive voice.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_19_0	Mr. Smith was startled, but relieved to have a safe topic of conversation given him. He told her a great deal very quickly about plagues of insects. He told her that he had a brother who kept a fruit farm in Kent. He told her what fruit farmers do every year in Kent, and so on, and so on. While he talked a very odd thing happened. Mrs. Brown took out her little white handkerchief and began to dab her eyes. She was crying. But she went on listening quite composedly to what he was saying, and he went on talking, a little louder, a little angrily, as if he had seen her cry often before ; as if it were a painful habit. At last it got on his nerves. He stopped abruptly, looked out of the window, then leant towards her as he had been doing when I got in, and said in a bullying, menacing way, as if he would not stand any more nonsense,
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_20_0	"""So about that matter we were discussing. It'll be all right ? George will be there on Tuesday?"""
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_21_0	"""We shan't be late,"" said Mrs. Brown, gathering herself together with superb dignity."
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_22_0	Mr. Smith said nothing. He got up, buttoned his coat, reached his bag down, and jumped out of the train before it had stopped at Clapham Junction. He had got what he wanted, but he was ashamed of himself; he was glad to get out of the old lady's sight.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_23_0	Mrs. Brown and I were left alone together. She sat in her corner opposite, very clean, very small, rather queer, and suffering intensely, The impression she made was overwhelming. It came pouring out like a draught, like a smell of burning. What was it composed of that overwhelming and peculiar impression? Myriads of irrelevant and incongruous ideas crowd into one's head on such occasions; one sees the person, one sees Mrs. Brown, in the centre of all sorts of different scenes. I thought of her in a seaside house, among queer ornaments : sea-urchins, models of ships in glass cases. Her husband's medals were on the mantelpiece. She popped in and out of the room, perching on the edges of chairs, picking meals out of saucers, indulging in long, silent stares. The caterpillars and the oak-trees seemed to imply all that. And then, into this fantastic and secluded life, in broke Mr. Smith. I saw him blowing in, so to speak, on a windy day. He banged, he slammed. His dripping umbrella made a pool in the hall. They sat closeted together.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_24_0	And then Mrs. Brown faced the dreadful revelation. She took her heroic decision. Early, before dawn, she packed her bag and carried it herself to the station. She would not let Smith touch it. She was wounded in her pride, unmoored from her anchorage ; she came of gentlefolks who kept servants but details could wait. The important thing was to realise her character, to steep oneself in her atmosphere. I had no time to explain why I felt it somewhat tragic, heroic, yet with a dash of the flighty, and fantastic, before the train stopped, and I watched her disappear, carrying her bag, into the vast blazing station. She looked very small, very tenacious ; at once very frail and very heroic. And I have never seen her again, and I shall never know what became of her.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_25_0	"The story ends without any point to it. But I have not told you this anecdote to illustrate either my own ingenuity or the pleasure of travelling from Richmond to Waterloo. What I want you to see in it is this. Here is a character imposing itself upon another person. Here is Mrs. Brown making someone begin almost automatically to write a novel about her. I believe that all novels begin with an old lady in the corner opposite. I believe that all novels, that is to say, deal with character, and that it is to express character not to preach doctrines, sing songs, or celebrate the glories of the British Empire, that the form of the novel, so clumsy, verbose, and undramatic, so rich, elastic, and alive, has been evolved. To express character, I have said; but you will at once reflect that the very widest interpretation can be put upon those words. For example, old Mrs. Brown's character will strike you very differently according to the age and country in which you happen to be born. It would be easy enough to write three different versions of that incident in the train, an English, a French, and a Russian. The English writer would make the old lady into a ""character""; he would bring out her oddities and mannerisms; her buttons and wrinkles; her ribbons and warts. Her personality would dominate the book. A French writer would rub out all that ; he would sacrifice the individual Mrs. Brown"
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_25_1	to give a more general view of human nature; to make a more abstract, proportioned, and harmonious whole. The Russian would pierce through the flesh ; would reveal the soul the soul alone, wandering out into the Waterloo Road, asking of life some tremendous question which would sound on and on in our ears after the book was finished. And then besides age and country there is the writer's temperament to be considered. You see one thing in character, and I another. You say it means this, and I that. And when it comes to writing each makes a further selection on principles of his own. Thus Mrs. Brown can be treated in an infinite variety of ways, according to the age, country, and temperament of the writer.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_26_0	But now I must recall what Mr. Arnold Bennett says. He says that it is only if the characters are real that the novel has any chance of surviving. Otherwise, die it must. But, I ask myself, what is reality ? And who are the judges of reality ? A character may be real to Mr. Bennett and quite unreal to me. For instance, in this article he says that Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes is real to him: to me Dr. Watson is a sack stuffed with straw, a dummy, a figure of fun. And so it is with character after character in book after book. There is nothing that people differ about more than the reality of characters, especially in contemporary books. But if you take a larger view I think that Mr. Bennett is perfectly right. If, that is, you think of the novels which seem to you great novels War and Peace, Vanity Fair, Tristram Shandy, Madame Bovary, Pride and Prejudice, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Villette you think of these books, you do at once think of some character who has seemed to you so real (I do not by that mean so lifelike) that it has the power to make you think not merely of it itself, but of all sorts of things through its eyes religion, of love, of war, of peace, of family life, of balls in county towns, of sunsets, moonrises, the immortality of the soul. There is hardly any subject of
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_26_1	human experience that is left out of War and Peace it seems to me. And in all these novels all these great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character. Otherwise, they would not be novelists ; but poets, historians, or pamphleteers.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_27_0	But now let us examine what Mr. Bennett went on to say he said that there was no great novelist among the Georgian writers because they cannot create characters who are real, true, and convincing. And there I cannot agree. There are reasons, excuses, possibilities which I think put a different colour upon the case. It seems so to me at least, but I am well aware that this is a matter about which I am likely to be prejudiced, sanguine, and near-sighted. I will put my view before you in the hope that you will make it impartial, judicial, and broad-minded. Why, then, is it so hard for novelists at present to create characters which seem real, not only to Mr. Bennett, but to the world at large? Why, when October comes round, do the publishers always fail to supply us with a masterpiece ?
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_28_0	Surely one reason is that the men and women writing novels in 1910 or thereabouts had this great difficulty to face that there was no English novelist living from who they could learn their business. Mr. Conrad is a Pole ; which sets him apart, and makes him, however admirable, not very helpful. Mr. Hardy has written no novel since 1895. The most prominent and successful novelists in the year 1910 were, I suppose, Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy. Now it seems to me that to go to these men and ask them to teach you how to write a novel how to create characters that are real is precisely like going to a bootmaker and asking him to teach you how to make a watch. Do not let me give you the impression that I do not admire and enjoy their books. They seem to me of great value, and indeed of great necessity. There are seasons when it is more important to have boots than to have watches. To drop metaphor, I think that after the creative activity of the Victorian age it was quite necessary, not only for literature but for life, that someone should write the books that Mr. Wells, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Galsworthy have written. Yet what odd books they are! Sometimes I wonder if we are right to call them books at all. For they leave one with so strange a feeling of incompleteness and dissatisfaction. In order to complete them
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_28_1	it seems necessary to do something to join a society, or, more desperately, to write a cheque. That done, the restlessness is laid, the book finished ; it can be put upon the shelf, and need never be read again. But with the work of other novelists it is different. Tristram Shandy or Pride and Prejudice is complete in itself ; it is self-contained ; it leaves one with no desire to do anything, except indeed to read the book again, and to understand it better. The difference perhaps is that both Sterne and Jane Austen were interested in things in themselves ; in character in itself ; in the book in itself. Therefore everything was inside the book, nothing outside. But the Edwardians were never interested in character in itself; or in the book in itself. They were interested in something outside. Their books, then, were incomplete as books, and required that the reader should finish them, actively and practically, for himself.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_29_0	Perhaps we can make this clearer if we take the liberty of imagining a little party in the railway carriage Mr. Wells Mr. Galsworthy, Mr. Bennett are travelling to Waterloo with Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Brown, I have said, was poorly dressed and very small. She had an anxious, harassed look. I doubt whether she was what you call an educated woman. Seizing upon all these symptoms of the unsatisfactory condition of our primary schools with a rapidity to which I can do no justice, Mr. Wells would instantly project upon the windowpane a vision of a better, breezier, jollier, happier, more adventurous and gallant world, where these musty railway carriages and fusty old women do not exist ; where miraculous barges bring tropical fruit to Camberwell by eight o'clock in the morning ; where there are public nurseries, fountains, and libraries, dining-rooms, drawing-rooms, and marriages ; where every citizen is generous and candid, manly and magnificent, and rather like Mr. Wells himself. But nobody is in the least like Mrs. Brown. There are no Mrs. Browns in Utopia. Indeed I do not think that Mr. Wells, in his passion to make her what she ought to be, would waste a thought upon her as she is. And what would Mr. Galsworthy see ? Can we doubt that the walls of Doulton's factory would take his fancy? There are women in that factory who make twenty-five dozen earthenware pots every day. There are mothers in the Mile End Road who depend
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_29_1	upon the farthings which those women earn. But there are employers in Surrey who are even now smoking rich cigars while the nightingale sings. Burning with indignation, stuffed with information, arraigning civilisation, Mr. Galsworthy would only see in Mrs. Brown a pot broken on the wheel and thrown into the corner.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_30_0	Mr. Bennett, alone of the Edwardians, would keep his eyes in the carriage. He, indeed, would observe every detail with immense care. He would notice the advertisements; the pictures of Swanage and Portsmouth; the way in which the cushion bulged between the buttons; how Mrs. Brown wore a brooch which had cost three-and-ten-three at Whitworth's bazaar; and had mended both gloves indeed the thumb of the left-hand glove had been replaced. And he would observe, at length, how this was the non-stop train from Windsor which calls at Richmond for the convenience of middle-class residents, who can afford to go to the theatre but have not reached the social rank which can afford motor-cars, though it is true, there are occasions (he would tell us what), when they hire them from a company (he would tell us which). And so he would gradually sidle sedately towards Mrs. Brown, and would remark how she had been left a little copyhold, not freehold, property at Datchet, which, however, was mortgaged to Mr. Bungay the solicitor but why should.I presume to invent Mr. Bennett? Does not Mr. Bennett write novels himself ? I will open the first book that chance puts in my way Hilda Lessways. Let us see how he makes us feel that Hilda is real, true, and convincing, as a novelist should. She shut the door in a soft, controlled way, which showed the constraint of her relations with her mother. She was fond of reading Maud; she was endowed
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_30_1	with the power to feel intensely. So far, so good ; in his leisurely, surefooted way Mr. Bennett is trying in these first pages, where every touch is important, to show us the kind of girl she was.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_31_0	But then he begins to describe, not Hilda Lessways, but the view from her bedroom window, the excuse being that Mr. Skellorn, the man who collects rents, is coming along that way. Mr. Bennett proceeds:
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_32_0	"""The bailiwick of Turnhill lay behind her; and all the murky district of the Five Towns, of which Turnhill is the northern outpost, lay to the south. At the foot of Chatterley Wood the canal wound in large curves on its way towards the undefiled plains of Cheshire and the sea. On the canal-side, exactly opposite to Hilda's window, was a flour-mill, that sometimes made nearly as much smoke as the kilns and the chimneys closing the prospect on either hand. From the flour-mill a bricked path, which separated a considerable row of new cottages from their appurtenant gardens, led straight into Lessways Street, in front of Mrs. Lessways' house. By this path Mr. Skellorn should have arrived, for he inhabited the farthest of the cottages."""
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_33_0	One line of insight would have done more than all those lines of description ; but let them pass as the necessary drudgery of the novelist. And now where is Hilda? Alas. Hilda is still looking out of the window. Passionate and dissatisfied as she was, she was a girl with an eye for houses. She often compared this old Mr. Skellorn with the villas she saw from her bedroom window. Therefore the villas must be described. Mr. Bennett proceeds :
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_34_0	"""The row was called Freehold Villas: a consciously proud name in a district where much of the land was copyhold and could only change owners subject to the payment of 'fines,' and to the feudal consent of a 'court' presided over by the agent of a lord of the manor. Most of the dwellings were owned by their occupiers, who, each an absolute monarch of the soil, niggled in his sooty garden of an evening amid the flutter of drying shirts and towels. Freehold Villas symbolised the final triumph of Victorian economics, the apotheosis of the prudent and industrious artisan. It corresponded with a Building Society Secretary's dream of paradise. And indeed it was a very real achievement. Nevertheless, Hilda’s irrational contempt would not admit this."""
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_35_0	Heaven be praised, we cry! At last we are coming to Hilda herself. But not so fast. Hilda may have been this, that, and the other; but Hilda not only looked at houses, and thought of houses; Hilda lived in a house. And what sort of a house did Hilda live in? Mr. Bennett proceeds:
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_36_0	"""It was one of the two middle houses of a detached terrace of four houses built by her grandfather Lessways, the tea-pot manufacturer ; it was the chief of the four, obviously the habitation of the proprietor of the terrace. One of the corner houses comprised a grocer's shop, and this house had been robbed of its just proportion of garden so that the seigneurial garden-plot might be triflingly larger than the other. The terrace was not a terrace of cottages, but of houses rated at from twenty-six to thirty-six pounds a year ; beyond the means of artisans and petty insurance agents and rent-collectors. And further, it was well built, generously built ; and its architecture, though debased, showed some faint traces of Georgian amenity. It was admittedly the best row of houses in that newly settled quarter of the town. In coming to it out of Freehold Villas Mr. Skellorn obviously came to something superior, wider, more liberal. Suddenly Hilda heard her mother's voice. ..."""
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_37_0	But we cannot hear her mother's voice, or Hilda's voice: we can only hear Mr. Bennett's voice telling us facts about rents and freeholds and copyholds and fines. What can Mr. Bennett be about? I have formed my own opinion of what Mr. Bennett is about he is trying to make us imagine for him; he is trying to hypnotise us into the belief that, because he has made a house, there must be a person living there. With all his powers of observation, which are marvellous, with all his sympathy and humanity, which are great, Mr. Bennett has never once looked at Mrs. Brown in her corner. There she sits in the corner of the carriage that carriage which is travelling, not from Richmond to Waterloo, but from one age of English literature to the next, for Mrs. Brown is eternal, Mrs. Brown is human nature, Mrs. Brown changes only on the surface, it is the novelists who get in and out there she sits and not one of the Edwardian writers has so much as looked at her. They have looked very powerfully, searchingly, and sympathetically out of the window; at factories, at Utopias, even at the decoration and upholstery of the carriage ; but never at her, never at life, never at human nature. And so they have developed a technique of novel-writing which suits their purpose; they have made tools and established conventions which do their business. But those tools are not our tools, and that
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_37_1	business is not our business. For us those conventions are ruin, those tools are death.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_38_0	You may well complain of the vagueness of my language. What is a convention, a tool, you may ask, and what do you mean by saying that Mr. Bennett�s and Mr. Wells�s and Mr. Galsworthy�s conventions are the wrong conventions for the Georgian�s? The question is difficult: I will attempt a short cut. A convention in writing is not much different from a convention in manners. Both in life and in literature it is necessary to have some means of bridging the gulf between the hostess and her unknown guest on the one hand, the writer and his unknown reader on the other. The hostess bethinks her of the weather, for generations of hostesses have established the fact that this is a subject of universal interest.in which we all believe. She begins by saying that we are having a wretched May, and, having thus got into touch with her unknown guest, proceeds to matters of greater interest. So it is in literature. The writer must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognises, which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him willing to co-operate in the far more difficult business of intimacy. And it is of the highest importance that this common meeting-place should be reached easily, almost instinctively, in the dark, with one�s eyes shut. Here is Mr. Bennett making use of this common ground in the passage which I have quoted. The problem before him was to make us believe in the
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_38_1	reality of Hilda Lessways. So he began, being an Edwardian, by describing accurately and minutely the sort of house Hilda lived in, and the sort of house she saw from the window. House property was the common ground from which the Edwardians found it easy to proceed to intimacy. Indirect as it seems to us, the convention worked admirably, and thousands of Hilda Lessways were launched upon the world by this means. For that age and generation, the convention was a good one.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_39_0	But now, if you will allow me to pull my own anecdote to pieces, you will see how keenly I felt the lack of a convention, and how serious a matter it is when the tools of one generation are useless for the next. The incident had made a great impression on me. But how was I to transmit it to you? All I could do was to report as accurately as I could what was said, to describe in detail what was worn, to say, despairingly, that all sorts of scenes rushed into my mind, to proceed to tumble them out pell-mell, and to describe this vivid, this overmastering impression by likening it to a draught or a smell of burning. To tell you the truth, I was also strongly tempted to manufacture a three-volume novel about the old lady�s son, and his adventures crossing the Atlantic, and her daughter, and how she kept a milliner�s shop in Westminster, the past life of Smith himself, and his house at Sheffield, though such stories seem to me the most dreary, irrelevant, and humbugging affairs in the world.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_40_0	But if I had done that I should have escaped the appalling effort of saying what I meant. And to have got at what I meant I should have had to go back and back and back; to experiment with one thing and another ; to try this sentence and that, referring each word to my vision, matching it as exactly as possible, and knowing that somehow I had to find a common ground between us, a convention which would not seem to you too odd, unreal, and far-fetched to believe in. I admit that I shirked that arduous undertaking. I let my Mrs. Brown slip through my fingers. I have told you nothing whatever about her. But that is partly the great Edwardians� fault. I asked them � they are my elders and betters � How shall I begin to describe this woman�s character ? And they said, �Begin by saying that her father kept a shop in Harrogate. Ascertain the rent. Ascertain the wages of shop assistants in the year 1878. Discover what her mother died of. Describe cancer. Describe calico. Describe�� But I cried, �Stop! Stop!� And I regret to say that I threw that ugly, that clumsy, that incongruous tool out of the window, for I knew that if I began describing the cancer and the calico, my Mrs. Brown, that vision to which I cling though I know no way of imparting it to you, would have been dulled and tarnished and vanished for ever.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_41_0	That is what I mean by saying that the Edwardian tools are the wrong ones for us to use. They have laid an enormous stress upon the fabric of things. They have given us a house in the hope that we may be able to deduce the human beings who live there. To give them their due, they have made that house much better worth living in. But if you hold that novels are in the first place about people, and only in the second about the houses they live in, that is the wrong way to set about it. Therefore, you see, the Georgian writer had to begin by throwing away the method that was in use at the moment. He was left alone there facing Mrs. Brown without any method of conveying her to the reader. But that is inaccurate. A writer is never alone. There is always the public with him � if not on the same seat, at least in the compartment next door. Now the public is a strange travelling companion. In England it is a very suggestible and docile creature, which, once you get it to attend, will believe implicitly what it is told for a certain number of years. If you say to the public with sufficient conviction, �All women have tails, and all men humps,� it will actually learn to see women with tails and men with humps, and will think it very revolutionary and probably improper if you say �Nonsense. Monkeys
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_41_1	have tails and camels humps. But men and women have brains, and they have hearts; they think and they feel,� � that will seem to it a bad joke, and an improper one into the bargain.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_42_0	But to return. Here is the British public sitting by the writer�s side and saying in its vast and unanimous way, �Old women have houses. They have fathers. They have incomes. They have servants. They have hot water bottles. That is how we know that they are old women. Mr. Wells and Mr. Bennett and Mr. Galsworthy have always taught us that this is the way to recognise them. But now with your Mrs. Brown � how are we to believe in her ?. We do not even know whether her villa was called Albert or Balmoral; what she paid for her gloves; or whether her mother died of cancer or of consumption. How can she be alive? No; she is a mere figment of your imagination.�
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_43_0	And old women of course ought to be made of freehold villas and copyhold estates, not of imagination.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_44_0	The Georgian novelist, therefore, was in an awkward predicament. There was Mrs. Brown protesting that she was different, quite different, from what people made out, and luring the novelist to her rescue by the most fascinating if fleeting glimpse of her charms; there were the Edwardians handing out tools appropriate to house building and house breaking ; and there was the British public asseverating that they must see the hot water bottle first. Meanwhile the train was rushing to that station where we must all get out.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_45_0	Such, I think, was the predicament in which the young Georgians found themselves about the year 1910. Many of them � I am thinking of Mr. Forster and Mr. Lawrence in particular � spoilt their early work because, instead of throwing away those tools, they tried to use them. -They tried to compromise. They tried to combine their own direct sense of the oddity and significance of some character with Mr. Galsworthy�s knowledge of the Factory Acts, and Mr. Bennett�s knowledge of the Five Towns. They tried it, but they had too keen, too overpowering a sense of Mrs. Brown and her peculiarities to go on trying it much longer. Something had to be done. At whatever cost of life, limb, and damage to valuable property Mrs. Brown must be rescued, expressed, and set in her high relations to the world before the train stopped and she disappeared for ever. And so the smashing and the crashing began. Thus it is that we hear all round us, in poems and novels and biographies, even in newspaper articles and essays, the sound of breaking and falling, crashing and destruction. It is the prevailing sound of the Georgian age rather a melancholy one if you think what melodious days there have been in the past, if you think of Shakespeare and Milton and Keats or even of Jane Austen and Thackeray and Dickens ; if you think of the language, and the heights to which it can soar when free, and see
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_45_1	the same eagle captive, bald, and croaking.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_46_0	In view of these facts � with these sounds in my ears and these fancies in my brain � I am not going to deny that Mr. Bennett has some reason when he complains that our Georgian writers are unable to make us believe that our characters are real. I am forced to agree that they do not pour out three immortal masterpieces with Victorian regularity every autumn. But instead of being gloomy, I am sanguine. For this state of things is, I think, inevitable whenever from hoar old age or callow youth the convention ceases to be a means of communication between writer and reader, and becomes instead an obstacle and an impediment. At the present moment we are suffering, not from decay, but from having no code of manners which writers and readers accept as a prelude to the more exciting intercourse of friendship. The literary convention of the time is so artificial � you have to talk about the weather and nothing but the weather throughout the entire visit � that, naturally, the feeble are tempted to outrage, and the strong are led to destroy the very foundations and rules of literary society. Signs of this are everywhere apparent. Grammar is violated; syntax disintegrated; as a boy staying with an aunt for the week-end rolls in the geranium bed out of sheer desperation as the solemnities of the sabbath wear on. The more adult writers do not, of course, indulge in such wanton exhibitions of spleen. Their
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_46_1	sincerity is desperate, and their courage tremendous; it is only that they do not know which to use, a fork or their fingers. Thus, if you read Mr. Joyce and Mr. Eliot you will be struck by the indecency of the one, and the obscurity of the other. Mr. Joyce�s indecency in Ulysses seems to me the conscious and calculated indecency of a desperate man who feels that in order to breathe he must break the windows. At moments, when the window is broken, he is magnificent. But what a waste of energy! And, after all, how dull indecency is, when it is not the overflowing of a super-abundant energy or savagery, but the determined and public-spirited act of a man who needs fresh air! Again, with the obscurity of Mr. Eliot. I think that Mr. Eliot has written some of the loveliest single lines in modern poetry. But how intolerant he is of the old usages and politenesses of society respect for the weak, consideration for the dull! As I sun myself upon the intense and ravishing beauty of one of his lines, and reflect that I must make a dizzy and dangerous leap to the next, and so on from line to line, like an acrobat flying precariously from bar to bar, I cry out, I confess, for the old decorums, and envy the indolence of my ancestors who, instead of spinning madly through mid-air, dreamt quietly in the shade with a book. Again, in Mr. Strachey�s books,
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_46_2	�Eminent Victorians,� and �Queen Victoria,� the effort and strain of writing against the grain and current of the times is visible too. It is much less visible, of course, for not only is he dealing with facts, which are stubborn things, but he has fabricated, chiefly from eighteenth-century material, a very discreet code of manners of his own, which allows him to sit at table with the highest in the land and to say a great many things under cover of that exquisite apparel which, had they gone naked, would have been chased by the men-servants from the room. Still, if you compare �Eminent Victorians�� with some of Lord Macaulay�s essays, though you will feel that Lord Macaulay is always wrong, and Mr. Strachey always right, you will also feel a body, a sweep, a richness in Lord Macaulay�s essays which show that his age was behind him; all his strength went straight into his work ; none was used for purposes of concealment or of conversion. But Mr. Strachey has had to open our eyes before he made us see ; he has had to search out and sew together a very artful manner of speech; and the effort, beautifully though it is concealed, has robbed his work of some of the force that should have gone into it, and limited his scope.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_47_0	For these reasons, then, we must reconcile ourselves to a season of failures and fragments. We must reflect that where so much strength is spent on finding a way of telling the truth the truth itself is bound to reach us in rather an exhausted and chaotic condition. Ulysses, Queen Victoria, Mr. Prufrock � to give Mrs. Brown some of the names she has made famous lately � is a little pale and dishevelled by the time her rescuers reach her. And it is the sound of their axes that we hear � vigorous and stimulating sound in my ears � unless of course you wish to sleep, when, in the bounty of his concern, Providence has provided a host of writers anxious and able to satisfy your needs.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_48_0	Thus I have tried, at tedious length, I fear, to answer some of the questions which I began by asking. I have given an account of some of the difficulties which in my view beset the Georgian writer in all his forms. I have sought to excuse him. May I end by venturing to remind you of the duties and responsibilities that are yours as partners in this business of writing books, as companions in the railway carriage, as fellow travellers with Mrs. Brown? For she is just as visible to you who remain silent as to us who tell stories about her. In the course of your daily life this past week you have had far stranger and more interesting experiences than the one I have tried to describe. You have over-heard scraps of talk that filled you with amazement. You have gone to bed at night bewildered by the complexity of your feelings. In one day thousands of ideas have coursed through your brains; thousands of emotions have met, collided, and disappeared in astonishing disorder. Nevertheless, you allow the writers to palm off upon you a version of all this, an image of Mrs. Brown, which has no likeness to that surprising apparition whatsoever, In your modesty you seem to consider that writers are of different blood and bone from yourselves ; that they know more of Mrs. Brown than you do. Never was there a more fatal mistake. It is this division between reader and writer, this
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_48_1	humility on your part, these professional airs and graces on ours, that corrupt and emasculate the books which should be the healthy offspring of a close and equal alliance between us. Hence spring those sleek, smooth novels, those portentous and ridiculous biographies, that milk and watery criticism, those poems melodiously celebrating the innocence of roses and sheep which pass so plausibly for literature at the present time.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_49_0	Your part is to insist that writers shall come down off their plinths and pedestals, and describe beautifully if possible, truthfully at any rate, our Mrs. Brown. You should insist that she is an old lady of unlimited capacity and infinite variety ; capable of appearing in any place ; wearing any dress ; saying anything and doing heaven knows what. But the things she says and the things she does and her eyes and her nose and her speech and her silence have an overwhelming fascination, for she is, of course, the spirit we live by, life itself.
1-1-bennett-brown	doc_22_50_0	But do not expect just at present a complete and satifactory presentment of her. Tolerate the spasmodic, the obscure, the fragmentary, the failure. Your help is invoked in a good cause. For I will make one final and surpassingly rash prediction—we are trembling on the verge of one of the great ages of English literature. But it can only be reached if we are determined never, never to desert Mrs. Brown.

2-9-posterity	doc_23_1_0	REMARKS
2-9-posterity	doc_23_2_0	I once wrote a book called Western Civilization and the Far East, of which a distinguished critic wrote that its most interesting feature was the postwar mentality which brooded over it. He belonged, of course, to the generation which looked on the system of the balance of power as the best of all possible international arrangements. This generation was not permitted by Providence to appreciate the fact that the system of the balance of power which, inits efforts to preserve equipoise, continually added weight and counterweight to either end of the see-saw, would eventually cause the plank of peace to split in the middle. I, on the other hand, belong to the generation which by time of birth was doomed to be sacrificed by the million, whilst those of us who survive are faced with the task of endeavouring to clear up the mess, and—if one has any sense of humanity — of preventing the repetition of the disaster.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_3_0	The question as to which nation started the war seems now to be of no consequence whatsoever, and the fact that a number — I hope a decreasing number of people — still attach importance to this matter, is a distressing indication of how far we have yet to travel before the great majority of educated persons are able to see the Great War in its true light.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_4_0	Viewed as an incident in the slow process by which man is changing from an ape to an angel, the War was an inevitable consequence of the manner in which international society was organised in 1914. It may be, it probably is, primarily a German responsibility that the consequence materialised in 1914 and not 1920 or 1930. But it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it had to come. There was no other avenue of escape from the ludicrous paradox which overshadowed the 1914 world. That world lived a double life and maintained two establishments and modes of thought; in 1914 rival mistresses encountered each other.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_5_0	On the one hand mankind in 1914 busied itself by spinning an intricate web of Internationalism, which was flung round the world. Methods of international trade, of communications and intercourse, were continually being improved and extended in their scope and convenience.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_6_0	On the other hand the nations maintained beneath this wel, costly and uneconomic armed forces and organisations whose function was the destruction of the marvellous fabric of Internationalism which man was creating and in which he took such pride. The maintenance of these forces, justified by the needs of what was called ‘“‘Defence,”” was due to an idea which was the child of a theory of Nationalism based on the fallacy that profit in the world (in the international sense) could only be obtained at the expense of another nation.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_7_0	Civilised people had recognised the absurdity of this theory in the case of domestic national affairs for several centuries.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_8_0	So long as this fallacy fermented men’s minds, “Defence” forces were necessary. For so long as this fallacy has a substantial following amongst civilised men “Defence” forces will remain necessary. Particularly necessary to the British Empire.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_9_0	But a day will come, though it is unlikely that we shall live to see it, when it will be generally recognised that though human nature may change very slowly, if at all, yet war as a method of settling disputes between nations is both barbarous and stupid.

2-9-posterity	doc_23_42_0	(Enter a Cabinet Minister in morning coat.)
2-9-posterity	doc_23_43_0	Cabinet Minister. What was the War? Ah! how often have I explained the fndamental causes of that great conflict between right and wrong, the struggle for democracy, for er—ah — self determination — within reasonable
2-9-posterity	doc_23_44_0	2nd Sol. Garn! I'll tell you why I died! It was all because a ruddy fool « of a colonel misread ’is ruddy orders, ’e did, and we walks into a ruddy barrage, we did! Strike me pink! ’ere is the old boy! Party, ’Tention!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_45_0	(Enter a Colonel.)
2-9-posterity	doc_23_46_0	Colonel (examining 1st Soldier): — Not a very good shave this morning, — I fear. This is an occasion, Smith, oF : which I expect every man in the regiment to do himself, the regiment, and me the utmost credit.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_47_0	2nd Sol. (strictly at attention). Very good, sir! | Sailor. Good old British Army!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_48_0	Colonel (to Sailor) You may be unaware that I rank with a post-captain.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_49_0	Sailor. Beg pardon, sir! no disrespect meant. 18
2-9-posterity	doc_23_50_0	Colonel. Say no more about it. My regiment has had the honour of co-operating with the Royal Navy on several occasions.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_51_0	C.M. (addressing Colonel). Permit me to introduce myself, my dear sir. I am - I should say I was, on earth - Lord Blatherington.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_52_0	Colonel. I remember your career perfectly well. You were in the Cabinet at some time or other, were you not.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_53_0	C.M. I had that honour.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_54_0	Colonel. I always understood at the club that you favoured the Eastern policy.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_55_0	C.M. I certainly inclined that way.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_56_0	Colonel. Well, let me take this opportunity of telling you that you and your friends were utterly and damnably wrong.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_57_0	C.M. Er - hum - a - this is rather strong language in the precincts, Colonel—er—distinctly unparliament-ary I should say
2-9-posterity	doc_23_58_0	Colonel. It’s the truth, and as such particularly appropriate here.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_59_0	1st Sol. Excuse me, sir, but could I have a word with you privately?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_60_0	Colonel. Certainly, my man! (They move aside.) ;
2-9-posterity	doc_23_61_0	1st Sol. Well, it’s like this ere, sir. I’ve got two things on me conscience and I’d like your ’elp, sir!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_62_0	Colonel. Well, come along, have them.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_63_0	1st Sol. The first is about B Company’s rum. I was corporal in charge of the details bringing up the rum 1? December 1917—we wos in the salient and, my Gawd, it was cold!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_64_0	Colonel. Yes! Yes! go on man!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_65_0	1st Sol. Well, we got lost in the mud abaht 3 ack emma.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_66_0	Colonel. Yes!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_67_0	let’s
2-9-posterity	doc_23_68_0	POSTERITY
2-9-posterity	doc_23_69_0	Ist Sol. And we didn’t get to company ’eadquarters till 9 o'clock. It come on all foggy,
2-9-posterity	doc_23_70_0	Colonel. Yes!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_71_0	1st Sol. Well, you see, sir! the rum---
2-9-posterity	doc_23_72_0	Colonel. Yes! Yes! Yes!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_73_0	1st Sol. Well, sir! we drunk it ourselves and said as 'ow the rum-jars 'ad been chipped by M.G. bullets.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_74_0	Colonel. The devil you did!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_75_0	1st Sol. Yes, sir.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_76_0	Colonel (after reflection). It was a very serious military offence. Were you not suspected?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_77_0	1st sol. No, sir! the sargeant-major 'e thought a lot out loud and made some nasty remarks, but we was all in it together and we kept our mouths shut.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_78_0	Colonel. And what is the other matter on your conscience?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_79_0	1st Sol. (confidentially). It’s about a woman, sir.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_80_0	Colonel. I always left women to Major Spencer, my second in command, a bachelor with immense experience. However, I suppose I must deal with your case. What are the details? Same
2-9-posterity	doc_23_81_0	old story, I suppose?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_82_0	1st Sol. She was a girl in Portsmouth, sir, called Ivy Jones, and we walked out in 1914.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_83_0	Sailor (who has moved over). Was she a red-headed skirt what was supposed to be going to marry some flat-footed grabby in France?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_84_0	Colonel (to Sailor). We’ll hear your reminiscences in a moment, my man. (To Sailor) Well, and what happened?!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_85_0	1st Sol. Well, I went to France; she was expecting, and I wrote regular and never heard nothing, and I put in for leave to make a’ honest woman of ’er,and I stopped one the week before I was due to go to Blighty. And the last thing I thought of, ’anging on the barbed wire, was my old Ivy and ’ow she never could be an ’onest woman.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_86_0	Sailor. Dontcher believe it, mate, When was you killed?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_87_0	1st Sol. January 1916,
2-9-posterity	doc_23_88_0	Sailor. Well, Ivy and me ’ad been spliced three months by then — that’s why she didn’t write to you.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_89_0	Ist Sol. Strewth! What abaht the kid, mate?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_90_0	Sailor. Born in March, he was. I always said he was a bit quick on it, but 'er mother what ’ad ’ad eleven, bluffed me proper, she did. Well, any’ow, she was a good-looking girl.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_91_0	Colonel, Well, that matter is settled, and as far as the rum is concerned, I'll see what can be done. I'm not acquainted with the exact procedure which is employed here, but I presume that a colonel will carry a good deal of weight, and I shall put in a word for you. Still, it was a serious military offence, and you can’t expect to get off scot free.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_92_0	1st Sol. No, sir. ‘Thank you, sir!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_93_0	C.M. I confess to a certain amount of curiosity as to the procedure when the Court opens.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_94_0	Colonel. I ask for nothing better than court-martial routine; we don’t want any lawyers butting in. In any case, so far as I can remember the drill as laid down, we have all pleaded guilty in advance.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_95_0	C.M. I have certainly done nothing of the sort!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_96_0	Colonel. I presume that you have at some time in your career attended a place of public worship and openly admitted you were a miserable sinner?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_97_0	C.M. If I did it was only as a matter of form and entirely without prejudice. The admission, I mean. In any case I doubt if that it would be evidence in a properly constituted Court of Law. Among other offices I have held was that of Home Secretary, and I know a good deal about the Law of Evidence.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_98_0	Colonel. My experience has been, never try to bamboozle the Court, and I certainly shan't try and fool this one.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_99_0	C.M. (musingly). I hope that my obituary notice in the Times is amongst the documents in my dossier. They gave me three and a half columns.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_100_0	Colonel. Humph! I only had four lines on the front page, and my wife paid for those. Piece of hypocrisy!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_101_0	C.M. How so?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_102_0	"Colonel. She put at the end, ""Mourned for ever."" I've never read such tommy rot; she was married again within the year. It was a guinea lie."
2-9-posterity	doc_23_103_0	(Enter the Bishop of Sevenoaks and the Bishop OF Grinzelheim.)
2-9-posterity	doc_23_104_0	C.M. My dear Bishop! this is indeed a pleasure!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_105_0	Bishop of Sevenoaks. Peace be with you!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_106_0	Sailor.(the Two Soldiers and Sailor have been playing nap). Hullo! here’s a padre! now we’re on velvet, he’ll be able to help us.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_107_0	Sailor. I say, padre?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_108_0	Bishop (to C.M.), Excuse me! Allow me to introduce my colleague, the Bishop of Grinzelheim, the Bishop of G.—Lord Blatherington. (Zo Sa1Lok) Peace be with you!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_109_0	Sailor. But it ain’t, that’s my trouble. es What’s your difficulty, my
2-9-posterity	doc_23_110_0	Sailor. Well, it’s like this here, I was in a cruiser at Jutland and there was a lull in the action——
2-9-posterity	doc_23_111_0	Bisnor. Jutland? the name is familiar to me!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_112_0	Bishop of Grinzelheim. He means the German victory off Skajerack.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_113_0	Sailor. Hold hard, old goat face, you don’t know what you're talking about. You only read the German newspapers. It was a British victory all right.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_114_0	C.M. Shall we call it an indecisive action? There has been a lot of correspondence about it.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_115_0	Colonel, No, we shall not. Why, you'll tell me we didn’t win the war next!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_116_0	(Enter a NEUTRAL.)
2-9-posterity	doc_23_117_0	Neutral. Did you? Who are we?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_118_0	Colonel. Who the devil are you?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_119_0	Neutral. I was a neutral. I was ruined and my wife was killed by your war.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_120_0	C.M. Most unfortunate!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_121_0	B of S. & B of G. Deplorable! Lamentable!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_122_0	Sailor. You ought to have had the savee to come in on our side like most of the other nootrals when they saw how the cat was moving.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_123_0	Neutral. Yes, but how was the cat moving? Listen, I was a man of importance in my country and
2-9-posterity	doc_23_124_0	C.M. What! did you hold Cabinet rank?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_125_0	Neutral. I did.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_126_0	C.M. My dear sir, so did I! Allow me to introduce myself, Lord Blatherington.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_127_0	Neutral. I am delighted to have had this opportunity of renewing our acquaintance, C.M. What! have we met before?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_128_0	Neutral. Oh yes, at Versailles. I was one of the delegates. We met at a sub-committee meeting of the Big Three, you were one of the little twenty-six, and I was one of the lesser thirty-eight. We were forced into the War at the end.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_129_0	C.M. Hum! I can't recollect the event. Later on, you know, I became one of the Ten - the big Ten.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_130_0	Neutral. As I was saying, how could we tell which way the cat was moving? In 1914, Germany was winning, in 1914 Germany was losing, in 1915 and 1916 it was see-saw, in 1917 Russia died, America came in. In 1918 Germany was winning, and in 1918 she'd lost - or so we all thought, but really she'd won. The whole thing was madness.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_131_0	C.M. Hush! Hush! You really must not talk like that.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_132_0	Colonel. Damn nonsense!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_133_0	B. of S. B. of G. Really, Colonel, have some respect for us and your surroundings.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_134_0	Colonel. Your Grace and I are in the same cart here, I imagine.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_135_0	B. of S. Peace be with you!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_136_0	Neutral. I repeat, madness! this war was an ill-begotten child of our civilisation that burst ruthlessly from the delicate womb in which it should have been aborted. It was a boil from which exuded all the beastliness we glossed over with the rouge and powder of our marvellous social organisation—and my wife, innocent, young, beautiful — (fiercely) Oh, damn you all! (hides head in hands).
2-9-posterity	doc_23_137_0	B. of G. The consolation of religion, the helping hands of its ministers were available to support you in your trouble.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_138_0	Neutral. Helping hands! blood-stained like the rest of them. Hypocrites!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_139_0	Bishops (in unison). Peace be with you! Sailor. Excuse me interrupting, but I was asking your advice, padre.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_140_0	B. of S. To be sure you were. Pray continue.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_141_0	Sailor. There was a lull in the action, and me and two other blokes in a turret Started to play a game of Crown and Anchor. Well, I might as well be honest about it. I cheated a leading seaman called George Taylor, and as I cheated we was 'it in the magazine, and 4s my poor body left me I saw a look in me eyes that said as plain as I sez It now, “You are a something cheat,” and I tried all I know to say to George, the arf-dollar was his, but I was just too late. Now ’ow do I stand, padre? ’Ad I repented or did I die a cheat, eh?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_142_0	C.M. That’s the sort of question I used to ask notice for or alternatively plead the public interest.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_143_0	1st Sol. I reckon he’s tubbed you, sir!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_144_0	Colonel. The answer seems to be plain enough to me. Ten days’ detention!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_145_0	Sailor. That sounds fair enough.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_146_0	B. of S. But hardly disposes of the moral side of the matter. Were you gambling?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_147_0	2nd Sol. (sarcastically), Oh, dear me, no! you get money for nothing at Crown and Anchor, I don't think!
2-9-posterity	doc_23_148_0	Sailor. Well, I suppose you would call it a bit of a gamble.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_149_0	Bishop. Then both you and your friend were to blame, but considering the peculiar circumstances of the case and the undoubted fact that the will to represent was present, I am inclined to think you can set your mind at rest.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_150_0	B. of G. You were not a Roman Catholic by any chance, were you?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_151_0	Sailor. No, I was a Plymouth Brother.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_152_0	B. of G. That’s all right. for a moment that it might falling within My jurisdiction
2-9-posterity	doc_23_153_0	SAILOR (addressing Soldiers) What say get on with our little game, eh, mates?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_154_0	1st Sol. Good enough.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_155_0	2nd. Sol. But watch our naval friend close, Bill, after what we've just 'eard.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_156_0	Sailor. Now, then, that's enough from you.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_157_0	(They settle down to cards.)
2-9-posterity	doc_23_158_0	B. of G. To continue our conversation, I confess that I am far from satisfied with our position.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_159_0	B. of S. I take a more hopeful view than you do.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_160_0	B. of G. I wish I knew when His Holiness was to be expected.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_161_0	B. of S. With all due deference to the Bishop of Rome, and sympathetic though I am to Anglo-Catholic aspirations, I must frankly say that I could not accept his decision as binding.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_162_0	B. of G. We won’t go over that ground again—-
2-9-posterity	doc_23_163_0	C.M. This sounds like a theological-political discussion in which I might with propriety intervene. Though have never actually been Premier, two holders of that office have been good enough to consult me when high ecclesiastical preferments were in question. There is, perhaps, no harm in saying; my dear Bishop, that when Sevenoaks fell vacant I had just read a sermon of yours on the subject of righteousness and the War, and I pressed your case very strongly with the Prime Minister with—a—ah—the happiest results.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_164_0	B. of S. Thank you. It is curious that you should mention that sermon of mine. If you recollect, we had just suffered a rather serious reverse on the Western front, and one felt that a stiffener was needed—-a re-statement of our case in terms of Christianity. I was but the poor instrument, but it has always been a source of satisfaction to me that the recruiting figures in our district responded very sharply.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_165_0	C.M. But why curious?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_166_0	B. of S. Simply that it touches on a question that my brother the Bishop of Grinzelheim and myself have been discussing for some hours.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_167_0	"Colonel. (pacing up and down and Si rehearsing a part, speaking to himself). ""I believe in God, my King, my Country, and my Regiment, gentlemen!"" No, that won’t do! ""I believe in my God, my King, the British Empire, the British Army, and my Regiment, and always have done so, your Lordships!” Hum, that sounds better. “‘T was educated at Wellington and Sandhurst, served in the Great War, was mentioned six times in despatches, was unfaithful twice to my wife in France under great temptation, and owned up t0 one of Assisted by my lawyer, who was an M.P., defrauded the income tax years, and then I died.’ Yes, that sounds all right. and write it out."
2-9-posterity	doc_23_168_0	(Exit COLONEL.)
2-9-posterity	doc_23_169_0	B. of G. I wonder if that should b¢ treated asa confession. He may belong to me.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_170_0	C.M. Pardon my insistence, but what was it you two were discussing. I was a famous mediator in my time, and many a formula of mine off has put off until to-morrow the inconveniences of to-day.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_171_0	B. of S. Well, it was simply this. My brother-bishop and I were discussing the fact that during the War, as became our stations in life, we were both praying for victory and supporting the War from a Christian point of view.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_172_0	C.M. Rather confusing for the Deity, unless he appealed your appeals.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_173_0	B. of G. I can hardly be expected to subscribe to that idea.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_174_0	B. of S. Nor I.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_175_0	B. of G. But the consequence is that we are in a very awkward position.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_176_0	B. of S. At any rate a very illogical one.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_177_0	C.M. I suppose you both committed yourself irrevocably?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_178_0	B. of S. I distinctly remember comparing the Germans to Pagan savages satiated with the lust of destruction. C.M. You did, and excellent propaganda it made. I have found it a good rule in public life never to commit oneself, otherwise consistency becomes difficult.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_179_0	B. of G. Personally I shall leave my case entirely in the hands of His Holiness the Pope.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_180_0	B. of S. I almost envy you the Pope:
2-9-posterity	doc_23_181_0	B. of G. My dear fellow, come over to Rome. It’s been done before.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_182_0	C.M. I trust you will not forsake the Church by law established. bite the hand which fed you.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_183_0	B. of S. Certainly not. Still, I shall feel easier when it’s all over. Like one's first sermon, eh?

2-9-posterity	doc_23_191_0	American (thrusting himself the front). (To C.M.) Cut that right out! Say, guess I’m scheduled for the first appointment with this Saint! (fo St Peter) Now, sir, perhaps you can spare me a moment on a business matter.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_192_0	St Peter. Dear me, what a hustler you are! I think you are under a misapprehension.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_193_0	American. Now, say, be reasonable! I never expected to have to come to Court about it, and certainly the British have been on the level from the word go, but some of the others——.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_194_0	St Peter. I see you are under a falseimpression; where do you imagine you are?
2-9-posterity	doc_23_195_0	American. Well, now, if this isn’t a scream! Isn’t this lay-out in the Precincts of the Judgment Seat? St Paver. It is. Well, ain’t I gotta a case? Ain’t I gotta a right to sue for breach of contract? Ain’t I gotta——

2-9-posterity	doc_23_198_0	C.M. My dear sir, you were ever a race of idealists, and as my right reverend friends here would tell you, “What shall it profit a man... if he lose his soul.”
2-9-posterity	doc_23_199_0	American. Guess you are right, Mr---
2-9-posterity	doc_23_200_0	C.M. My name is Lord Blatherington. I was in the British Cabinet.
2-9-posterity	doc_23_201_0	American. Not the Lord Blatherington? (C.M. bows).
2-9-posterity	doc_23_202_0	American (extending hand). Say; this is a pleasure! I am glad to have you know me. I really do wish you could come and stay a piece with me in my home town. « I say, Saint, have you met Lord Blatherington? if not, permit me to introduce two of the world’s really prominent men. (Looks around.) Gosh! not a movie man in sight, and what a chance!

1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_0_0	ANONYMITY: An Enquiry
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_1_0	Do you like to know who a book’s by ?
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_2_0	The question is more profound and even more literary than may appear. A poem for example : do we gain more or less pleasure from it when we know the name of the poet? The Ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, for example. No one knows who wrote Sir Patrick Spens. It comes to us out of the northern void like a breath of ice. Set beside it another ballad whose author is known — The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. That, too, contains a tragic voyage and the breath of ice, but it is signed Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and we know a certain amount about this Coleridge. Coleridge signed other poems and knew other poets ; he ran away from Cambridge ; he enlisted as a Dragoon under the name of Trooper Comberback, but fell so constantly from his horse that it had to be withdrawn from beneath him permanently ; he was employed instead upon matters relating to sanitation; he married Southey’s sister, and gave lectures ; he became stout, pious and dishonest, took opium and died. With such information in our heads, we speak of the Ancient Mariner as “a poem by Coleridge,” but of Sir Patrick Spens as “a poem.” What difference, if any, does this difference between them make upon our minds? And in the case of novels and plays — does ignorance or knowledge of their authorship signify ? And newspaper articles — do they impress more when they are signed or unsigned ?. Thus
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_2_1	— rather vaguely — let us begin our quest.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_3_0	Books are composed of words, and words have two functions to perform : they give information or they create an atmosphere. Often they do both, for the two functions are not incompatible, but our enquiry shall keep them distinct. Let us turn for our next example to Public Notices. There is a word that is sometimes hung up at the edge of a tramline. the word “Stop.” Written on a metal label by the side of the line, it means that a tram should stop here presently. It is an example of pure information. It creates no atmosphere — at least, not in my mind. If I stand close to the label and wait and wait for the tram. If the tram comes, the information is correct ; if it doesn’t come, the information is incorrect ; but in either case it remains information, and the notice is an excellent instance of one of the uses of words.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_4_0	Compare it with another public notice which is sometimes exhibited in the darker cities of England : “ Beware of pickpockets, male and female.’ Here, again, there is information. A pickpocket may come along presently, just like a tram, and we take our measures accordingly. But there is something else besides. Atmosphere is created. Who can see those words without a slight sinking feeling at the heart ? All the people around look so honest and nice, but they are not, some of them are pickpockets, male or female. They hustle old gentlemen, the old gentleman glances down, his watch is gone. They steal up behind an old lady and cut out the back breadth of her beautiful sealskin jacket with sharp and noiseless pairs of scissors. Observe that happy little child running to buy sweets. Why does he suddenly burst into tears? A pickpocket, male or female, has jerked his halfpenny out of his hand. All this, and perhaps much more, occurs to us when we read the notice in question. We suspect our fellows of dishonesty, we observe them suspecting us. We have been reminded of several disquieting truths, of the general insecurity of life, human frailty, the violence of the poor, and the fatuous trustfulness of the rich, who always expect to be popular without having done anything to deserve it. It is a sort of memento mori, set up in the midst of Vanity Fair. By taking the form of a warning it has made us
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_4_1	afraid, although nothing is gained by fear ; all we need to do is to protect our precious purses, and fear will not help us to do this. Besides conveying information it has created an atmosphere, and to that extent is literature. ‘‘ Beware of pickpockets, male and female,” is not good literature, and it is unconscious. But the words are performing two functions, whereas the word ‘ Stop” only performed one, and this is an important difference, and the first step in our journey.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_5_0	Next step. Let us now collect together all the printed matter of the world into a single heap ; poetry books, exercise books, plays, newspapers, advertisements, street notices, everything. Let us arrange the contents of the heap into a line, with the works that convey pure information at one end, and the works that create pure atmosphere at the other end, and the works that do both in their intermediate positions, the whole line being graded so that we pass from one attitude to another. We shall find that at the end of pure information stands the tramway notice “Stop,” and that at the extreme other end is lyric poetry. Lyric poetry is absolutely no use, It is the exact antithesis of a street notice, for it conveys no information of any kind. What’s the use of “A slumber did my spirit seal’’ or “Whether on Ida’s snowy brow” or “So we'll go no more a roving”’ or “ Far in a western brookland”” ? They do not tell us where the tram will stop or even whether it exists. And, passing from lyric poetry to ballad, we are still deprived of information. It 1s true that the Ancient Mariner describes an antarctic expedition, but in such a muddled way that it is no real help to the ex: plorer, the accounts of the polar currents and winds being hopelessly inaccurate. It is true that the Ballad of Sir Patrick Spens refers to the bringing home of the Maid of
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_5_1	Notway, ee in the year 1285, but the reference is so vague and confused that the historians turn from it in despair. Lyric poetry is absolutely no use, and poetry generally is almost no use.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_6_0	But when, proceeding down the line, we leave poetry behind and arnve at the drama, and particularly at those plays that purport to contain normal human beings, we find a change. Uselessness still predominates, but we begin to get information as well. Julius Caesar contains some reliable information about Rome. And when we pass from the drama to the novel, the change is still more marked. Information abounds. What a lot we learn from Tom Jones about the west countryside ! And from Northanger Abbey about the same countryside fifty years later. In psychology too the novelist teaches us much. How carefully has Henry James explored certain selected recesses of the human mind! What an analysis of a country rectory in The Way of All Flesh! The instincts of Emily Bronté — they illuminate passion. And Proust — how amazingly does Proust describe not only French Society, not only the working of his characters, but the personal equipment of the reader, so that one keeps stopping with a gasp to say “Oh! how did he find that out about me? I didn’t even know it myself until he informed me, but it is so!” The novel, whatever else it may be, is partly a notice board. And that is why many men who do not care for poetry or even for the drama enjoy novels and are well qualified to criticise them.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_7_0	Beyond the novel we come to works whose avowed aim is information, works of learning, history, sociology, philosophy, psychology, science, ete. Uselessness is now subsidiary, though it still may persist as it does in the Decline and Fall or the Stones of Venice. And next come those works that give, or profess to give, us information about contemporary events : the newspapers. (Newspapers are so important and so peculiar that I shall return to them later, but mention them here in their place in the procession of printed matter.) And then come advertisements, time tables, the Price list inside a taxi and public notices : the notice warning us against pickpockets, its aim in the announcement “ Stop.”” It is a long journey from lyric poetry to a placard beside a tram line, but it is a journey in which which incidentally produced an atmosphere, though was information, and the pure information contained there are no breaks. Words are all of one family, and do not become different because some are printed in a book and others on a metal disc. It is their functions that differentiate them. They have two functions, and the combination of those functions is infinite. If there is on earth a house with many mansions, it is the house of words.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_8_0	Looking at this line of printed matter, let us again ask ourselves: Do I want to know who wrote that ? Ought it to be signed or not ?. The question is becoming more interesting. Clearly, in so far as words convey information, they ought to be signed. Information is supposed to be true. That is its only reason for existing, and the man who gives it ought to sign his name, so that he may be called to account if he has told a lie. When I have waited for several hours beneath the notice “ Stop,” I have the right to suggest that it be taken down, and I cannot do this unless I know who put it upMake your statement, sign your name, That’s common sense, But as we approach the other function of words—the oreaieg of atmosphere—the question of signature surely loses oe importance, It does not matter who wrote “A slumber did my spirit steal” because the poem itself does not matter. Ascribe it to Ella Wheeler Wilcox and the trams will run as usual. It does not matter much who wrote Julius Caesar and Tom Jones. They contain descriptions of ancient Rome and eighteenth century England, and to that extent we wish them signed, for we can judge from the author’s name whether the description is likely to be reliable; but beyond that, the guarantee of Shakespeare or Fielding might just as well be Charles Garvice’s. So we come to the conclusion, firstly, that
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_8_1	what is information ought to be signed ; and, secondly, that what is not information need not be signed.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_9_0	The question can now be carried a step further.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_10_0	What is this element in words that is not information i Lhave called it “atmosphere,” but it requires stricter definition than that. It resides not in any particular word, but in the order in which words are arranged—that is to say, in style. It is the power that words have to raise our emotions or quicken our blood. It is also something else, and to define that other thing would be to explain the secret of the universe. This “something else” in words is undefinable. It is their power to create not only atmosphere, but a world, which, while it lasts, seems more real and solid than this daily existence of pickpockets and trams. Before we begin to read the Ancient Mariner we know that the Polar Seas are not inhabited by spirits, and that if a man shoots an albatross he is not a criminal but a sportsman, and that if he stuffs the albatross afterwards he becomes a naturalist also. All this is common knowledge. But when we are reading the Ancient Mariner, or remembering it intensely, common knowledge disappears and y knowledge takes its place. We have entered a Universe that only answers to its own laws, supports itself, internally coheres, and has a new standard of truth. Information is true if it is accurate. A poem is true if it hangs together. Information points to something else. A poem points to nothing but itself, Information is relative. A poem is absolute. The world created by words
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_10_1	exists neither in space nor time though it has semblances of both, it is eternal and indestructible, and yet its action is no stronger than a flower: it is adamant, yet it is also what one of its practitioners thought it to be, namely, the shadow of a shadow. We can best define it by negations; It is not this world, its laws are not the laws of science or logic, its conclusions not those of common sense. And it causes us to suspend our ordinary judgments.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_11_0	Now comes the crucial point. While we are reading The Ancient Mariner we forget our astronomy and geography and daily ethics. Do we not also forget the author ? Does not Samuel Taylor Coleridge, lecturer, opium eater, and dragoon, disappear with the rest of the world of information ? We remember him before we begin the poem and after we finish it, but during the poem nothing exists but the poem. Comnsequently while we read The Ancient Mariner a change takes place in it. It becomes anonymous, like the Ballad of a Patrick Spens. And here is the point I would support : that all literature tends towards a condition of anonymity, and that, so far as words are creative, a signature merely distracts us from their true significance. I do not say literature “ought” not to be signed, because literature is alive, and consequently “ought” is the wrong word to use. It wants not to be signed. That puts my point. It is always tugging in that direction and saying in effect: “I, not my author, exist really.” So do the trees, flowers and human beings say “I really exist, not God, ” and continue to say so despite the admonitions to the contrary addressed to them by clergymen and scientists. To forget its Creator is one of the functions of a Creation. To remember him is to forget the days of one’s youth. Literature does not want to remember. It is alive—not in a vague complementary sense—but alive
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_11_1	tenaciously, and it is always covering up the tracks that connect it with the laboratory.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_12_0	It may here be objected that literature expresses personality, that it is the result of the author’s individual outlook, that we are right in asking for his name. It is his property— he ought to have the credit.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_13_0	An important objection ; also a modern one, for in the past neither writers nor readers attached the high importance to personality that they do to-day. It did not trouble Homer or the various people who were Homer. It did not trouble the writers in the Greek Anthology, who would write and re-write the same poem in almost identical language, their notion being that the poem, not the poet, is the important thing, and that by continuous rehandling the perfect expression natural to the poem may be attained.’ It did not trouble the medieval balladists, who, like the Cathedral builders, left their works unsigned. It troubled neither the composers nor the translators of the Bible. The Book of Genesis to-day contains at least three different elements — Jahvist, Elohist and Priestly — which were combined into a single account by a committee who lived under King Josiah at Jerusalem and translated into English by another committee who lived under King James I at London. And yet the Book of Genesis is literature. These earlier writers and readers knew that the words a man writes express him, but they did not make a cult of expression as we do to-day. Surely they were right, and modem critics go too far in their insistence on personality.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_14_0	They go too far because they do not reflect what personality is. Just as words have two functions — information and creation — so each human mind has two personalities, one on the surface, one deeper down. The upper personality has a name. It is called S. T. Coleridge, or William Shakespeare, or Mrs. Humphry Ward. It is conscious and alert, it does things like dining out, answering letters, etc., and it differs vividly and amusingly from other personalities. The lower Personality is a very queer affair, In many ways it is a perfect fool, but without it there is no literature, because, unless a man dips a bucket down into it occasionally he cannot produce first-class work. There is something general about it. Although it is inside S, T. Coleridge, it cannot be labelled with his name. It has something in common with all other deeper personalities, and the mystic will assert that the common quality is God, and that here, in the obscure recesses of our being, we near the gates of the Divine. It is in any case the force that makes for anonymity. As it came from the depths, so it soars to the heights, out of local questionings ; as it is general to all men, so the works it inspires have something general about them, namely beauty. The poet wrote the poem no doubt, but he forgot himself while he wrote it, and we forget him while we read. What is so wondertul about
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_14_1	great literature is that it transforms the man who reads it towards the condition of the man who wrote, and brings to birth in us also the creative impulse. Lost in the beauty where he was lost, we find more than we ever threw away, we reach what seems to be our spiritual home, and remember that it was not the speaker who was in the beginning but the Word.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_15_0	It we glance at one or two writers who are not first class this point will be illustrated. Charles Lamb and R. L. Stevenson willserve. Here are two gifted, sensitive, fanciful, tolerant, humorous fellows, but they always write with their surface personalities and never let down buckets into their underworld. Lamb did not try : bbbbuckets, he would have said, are bbeyond me, and he is the pleasanter writer in consequence. Stevenson was always trying oh ever so hard, but the bucket either stuck or else came up again full of the R.L.S. who let it down full of the mannerisms, the self-consciousness, the sentimentality, the quaintness which he was hoping to avoid. He and Lamb append their names in full to every sentence they write. They pursue us page after page, always to the exclusion of higher joy. They are letter writers, not creative artists, and it is no coincidence that each of them did write charming letters. A letter comes off the surface: it deals with the events of the day or with plans : it is naturally signed. Literature tries to be unsigned. And the proof is that, whereas we are always exclaiming “How like Lamb!” or “How typical of Stevenson!’’ we never say ‘“‘ How like Shakespeare!” or “ How typical of Dante!” We are conscious only of the world they have created, and we are in a sense co-partners in it. Coleridge, in his smaller domain, makes us co-partners too. We forget for ten minutes
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_15_1	his name and our own, and I contend that this temporary forgetfulness, this momentary and mutual anonymity, is sure evidence of good stuff. The demand that literature should express personality is far too insistent in these days, and I look back with longing to the earlier modes of criticism where a poem was not an expression but a discovery, and was sometimes supposed to have been shown to the poet by God.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_16_0	The personality of a writer does becomes important after we have read his book and begin to study it. When the glamour of creation ceases, when the leaves of the divine tree are silent, when the intelligible word is restored to the universe, when the co-partnership is over, then a book changes its nature, and we can ask ourselves questions about it such as “What is the author’s name?” ‘‘ Where did he live?” “Was he married ? ” and “‘ Which was his favourite flower ? ” Then we are no longer reading the book, we are studying it and making it subserve our desire for information, “Study” has a very solemn sound. “I am studying Dante” sounds much more than ‘‘I am reading Dante.’ It is really much less. Study is only a serious form of gossip. It teaches us everything about the book except the central thing, and between that and us it raises a circular barrier which only the wings of the spirit can cross. The study of science, history, etc., is necessary and proper, for they are subjects that belong to the domain of information, but a creative subject like literature—to study that is excessively dangerous, and should _ never be attempted by the immature. Modern education promotes the unmitigated study of literature and concentrates our attention on the relation between a writer’s life—his surface life—and his work. That is one reason why it is such a curse. There are no questions to be asked
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_16_1	about literature while we read it because “la paix succéde a la pensée.” An examination paper could not be set on the Ancient Mariner as it speaks to the heart of the reader, and it was to speak to the heart that it was written, and otherwise it would not have been written. Questions only occur when we cease to realise what it was about and become inquisitive and methodical.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_17_0	A word in conclusion on the newspapers—for they raise an interesting contributory issue. We have already defined a newspaper as something which conyeys, or is supposed to convey, information about passing events. It is true, not to itself like a poem, but to the facts it purports to relate — like the tram notice. When the morning paper arrives it lies upon the breakfast table simply steaming with truth in regard to something else. Truth, truth, and nothing but truth. Unsated by the banquet, we sally forth in the afternoon to buy an evening paper, which is published at mid-day as the name implies, and feast anew. At the end of the week we buy a weekly, or a Sunday, paper, which as the name implies has been written on the Saturday, and at the end of the month we buy a monthly. Thus do we keep in touch with the world of events as practical men should.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_18_0	And who is keeping us in touch? Who gives us this information upon which our judgments depend, and which must ultimately influence our characters ? Curious to relate, we seldom know. Newspapers are for the most part anonymous.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_19_0	Statements are made and no Signature appended. Suppose we read in a paper that the Emperor of Guatemala is dead. Our first feeling is one of mild consternation ; out of snobbery we regret what has happened, although the Emperor didn’t play much part in our lives, and if ladies we say to one another “ T feel so sorry for the poor Empress.”’ But presently we learn that the Emperor cannot have died, because Guatemala is a Republic, and the Empress cannot be a widow, because she does not exist. If the statement was signed, and we know the name of the goose who made it, we shall discount anything he tells us in the future. If —- which is more probable—it is unsigned or signed ‘‘ Our Special Correspondent ” — we remain defenceless against future misstatements. The Guatemala lad may be turned on to write about the Fall of the Franc and mislead us over that.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_20_0	It seems paradoxical that an article should impress us more if it is unsigned than if it is signed. But it does, owing to the weakness of our psychology. Anonymous statements have, as we have seen, a universal air about them. Absolute truth, the collected wisdom of the universe, seems to be speaking, not the feeble voice of a man. The modern newspaper has taken advantage of this. It is a pernicious caricature of literature. It has usurped that divine tendency towards anonymity. It has claimed for information what only belongs to creation. And it will claim it as long as we allow it to claim it, and to exploit the defects of our psychology. “The High Mission of the Press.” Poor Press ! as if it were in a position to have a mission! It is we who have a mission to it. To cure a man through the newspapers or through propaganda of any sort-is impossible : you merely alter the symptoms of his disease. We shall only be cured by purging our minds of confusion. The papers trick us not so much by their lies as by their exploitation of our weakness. They are always confusing the two functions of words and insinuating that ‘“‘ The Emperor of Guatemala is dead” and “A slumber did my spirit seal” belong to the same category. They are always usurping the privileges that only uselessness may claim, and they will do this as long as we allow them to do
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_20_1	it.
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_21_0	This ends our enquiry. The question “ Ought things to be signed ?”’ seemed, if not an easy question, at all events an isolated one, but we could not answer it without considering what words are, and disentangling the two functions they perform. We decided pretty easily that information ought to be signed : common sense leads to this conclusion, and newspapers which are largely unsigned have gained by that device their undesirable influence over civilisation. Creation—that we found a more difficult matter. ‘‘ Literature wants not to be signed ”’ I suggested. Creation comes from the depths—the mystic will say from God. The signature, the name, belongs to the surface-personality, and pertains to the world of information, it is a ticket, not the spirit of life. While the author wrote he forgot his name ; while we read him we forget both his name and our own. When we have finished reading we begin to ask questions, and to study the book and the author, we drag them into the realm of information. Now we learn a thousand things, but we have lost the pearl of great price, and in the chatter of question and answer, in the torrents of gossip and examination papers we forget the purpose for which creation was performed. I am not asking for reverence. Reverence is fatal to literature. My plea is for something more vital: imagination, Imagination is as the immortal God which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion (Shelley).
1-12-anonymity-inquiry	doc_24_21_1	Imagination is our only guide into the world created by words. Whether those words are signed or unsigned becomes, as soon as the imagination redeems us, a matter of no importance, because we have approximated to the state in which they were written, and there are no names down there, no personality as we understand personality, no marrying or giving in marriage. What there is down there —ah, that is another enquiry, and may the clergymen and the scientists pursue it more successfully in the future than they have in the past.

1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_2_0	WOMEN: AN INQUIRY
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_3_0	INTRODUCTORY
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_4_0	Men and women are latecomers to this planet, but they have existed for a very long time, judged by human standards. One might reasonably expect the difference between them, if it is an essential difference, to be now capable of formulation. An essential difference would be a difference distinctively human, that is, spiritual as well as physical, and at the same time distinctively sexual.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_5_0	External differences, such as the presence or absence of beards and other secondary sexual characteristics, do not satisfy the first part of this definition, and are to be disregarded. Many so-called differences in social behaviour are also not essential differences. A valuable book written by the Vaertings 1 has made this clear. In a State where men are dominant, as in most of our civilised States for the past two thousand years, certain attributes are considered to be characteristic of women which are equally characteristic of men in a State where women are dominant, as it is said they were for some time in ancient Egypt. The subordinate sex in each case is excluded from complete development, and is considered to be less intelligent, less courageous, and more domesticated than the dominant sex. In fact, men and women share jointly in what is called human nature, and are alike capable of courage, fear, cruelty, tenderness, intelligence, and stupidity. When exhilarated by power and responsibility they display the more dominating qualities, and in subordinate positions they manifest a “ slave psychology,” Therefore men and women are not to be differentiated as brave or timid, intelligent or stupid, strong or weak, because a classification of this kind is too broadly human and not distinctively sexual.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_6_0	It is not asserted that secondary physiological differences between the sexes or social differences in behaviour have no significence. Possibly sexual differentiation is so fundamental that it modifies the least reactions of men and women ; but to begin an investigation of these would require exhaustive scientific information outside the scope of this essay, which is an attempt to discover if the division of the human race into men and women involves a division of spiritual as well as of sexual functions, so that the creative work of women is different in kind from the creative work of men. From this point of view the differences mentioned are significant as effects rather than causes, and a consideration of them must be dismissed as unfruitful. The aim of this essay, then, is to find a conception of womanhood as something essentially different from manhood. An essential difference would persist through all the variations of behaviour caused by the dominance of either sex: consequently the validity of this inquiry is not impaired by the restriction of its material to the activities of men and women in our present one-sided civilisation. The knowledge that it is one-sided, because men have for so long been dominant over women, is valuable in helping to distinguish what is essential from what is accidental. The subordination of women makes it difficult but not impossible to recognise the essential quality of womanhood. In a masculine civilisation the creative work of women may be belittled, misinterpreted, or denied is
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_6_1	but if it is a reality, its existence will be proved at least by the emotional colour of the denial.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_7_0	I
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_8_0	It is therefore legitimate to consider the composite picture of woman presented to us by the beliefs and opinions recorded by men. These opinions are curiously contradictory and at the same time generalised. In spite of the intense interest felt in individual women, generalisations about women are common, whereas generalisations about men are made warily, if at all. Men are fellow creatures of many different kinds: conclusions are drawn about classes of men, such as kings, statesmen, or warriors, angry men, foolish men, or strangers; but nothing less than a universal attribute of humanity is attached to all men, such as that men are mortal, or subject to Fate, or inconstant. But it is seriously believed by Moslems that women have no souls. Thousands of Christians believe that women are not intelligent. Mystics believe that women are on a lower plane of spiritual development than men. Women have no sense of justice, no sense of honour: women cannot be trusted with political power : women are all the better for a good beating with a stick. These generalisations reflect man as the dominant sex, conscious of his superiority. But one comes at once upon contradictions. Every great man has been inspired by some woman. The hand that rocks the cradle indisputably rules the world. A woman was the first cause of original sin, but a woman was the Mother of God. What does this mean? Half of the picture is tinged with vague contempt, and the other half with vague
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_8_1	reverence. Apparently the average man sees woman alternately as an inferior being and as an angel.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_9_0	One must conclude that he is looking at her through a distorting medium. His conception of her as an inferior being is natural, in a man-made State, and were she really inferior it would stop there. His vague reverence for her remains to prevent this conclusion : it is certainly a compensation for something, a distorted recognition of some half-guessed-at power in women, It looks as if man knows that the inferiority of woman is a fiction, that his domination of her and his refusal to admit her to his own level are not justified. In the background there lurks a fear of reprisals. The distorting medium contains fear as one of its elements.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_10_0	In men’s societies of a primitive or arrested type where the etiquette of conduct betrays its origin, one can see clearly man’s fear of woman. Woman possesses some mysterious power which must be averted by elaborate taboos. A woman can ruin a man’s chances of success in hunting or fishing by touching his gear. A woman’s shadow can blight a religious ceremony. Women are particularly to be feared when they are menstruating or in childbed. ‘The most terrible ghost is that of a woman who dies in childbed. In more developed societies men burn old crones as witches in possession of the evil eye. And even to-day, especially in politics, men find it difficult to rid themselves of the uneasy suspicion that women are dangerous.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_11_0	This fear proves the artificiality of man’s domination. One can be sceptical of any claim to superiority which throws such a shadow. Natural domination, that domination of skill and experience which is expected of a physician in a sick-room, or of a captain on his ship, establishes itself without arrogance and fear, and is exercised within its natural limits in particular directions. The physician does not interfere with navigation; the captain claims no divine right of authority over medical prescriptions. But the domination claimed by men over women has been a kind of magical quality, an absolute and divine right of authority, a mass domination, and, like all other mass dominations, rooted in fear.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_12_0	But men’s fear of women proves only that women are not naturally inferior and subordinate. It does not prove that they are different from men. There remains the other side of the picture, however, with its sentimentalised ideal of women. A reverence for woman as a mother appears clearly: the mother is elevated to a place in heaven and worshipped as the Mother of God, or as the Mother of the Gods. Now motherhood is an undisputed function of women which they do not share with men. At the lowest estimate of their powers all women are potential mothers. Men are born of women, and of women only. It must be an important function, for men have tried to belittle it. The theology of the masculine world branded Eve as the first cause of evil, and explained the pains of child-birth as a just punishment from heaven. Still more significant, however, is the fact that Adam and Eve were created by a masculine God in a garden, and that the theologians could not leave them there. It was necessary to bring them from the plane of abstract art on to the plane of humanity. But only a woman can create human beings, and therefore it was the woman who had to bring them out of the mythical garden into reality—a confession of failure for the theologians, and they wreaked their revenge on Eve. Yet in spite of themselves they were driven to attribute to a woman the decisive action which
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_12_1	transformed the figments of a male God into men and women.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_13_0	But motherhood was smirched with original sin. Later on it was still further belittled. Women were regarded as mere receptacles, passive receptive bodies which created nothing. Men must have felt that motherhood was important, or they would not have tried to explain it away altogether. But the sentimental ideal of woman as the mother still persisted, especially among men, and could not be explained away : so, finally, motherhood was allowed by popular opinion to be a creative function, but of a purely physical nature, and it wag further defined as the sole justifiable function of women, Mr. Rudyard Kipling expressed this very neatly when he said that blind Nature made man for several ends and woman for only one. In Oriental countries the still more logical conclusion is drawn that women justify their existence only by producing men-children. In a society committed to this point of view childless women are failures in life, and the unmarried woman is a ridiculous nuisance. If social remedies such as polygamy, suttee, infanticide, or euthanasia are not put into practice, the phrase “ superfluous women ”’ comes into existence, and the State is shaken by the problem of what to do with its superfluous women.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_14_0	II
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_15_0	Yet if motherhood can be defined, rightly or wrongly, as the sole function of women, it must be a function which in some degree expresses the quality of womanhood as distinct from manhood. Even in this artificially narrowed field of activity one should be able to find some clue to the essential nature of women. It is therefore advisable first of all to compare motherhood and fatherhood.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_16_0	Fatherhood seems the more casual relationship of the two. It cannot be proved with the same certainty as motherhood. In a masculine State, where the father is the only legal parent, the institution of marriage is necessary to prevent fathers from successfully disclaiming their children. Maternity is not so easily denied, and in a feminine State it could be proved without the aid of a marriage contract. Where the mother is the sole legal parent civil marriage is unnecessary. Hence, as the Vaertings point out, bastardy is unknown in a feminine State. A mother’s connection with her child is more obvious and immediate than a father’s. A man can be a parent without knowing it : a woman cannot.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_17_0	Motherhood is also a greater tax on vital energy than fatherhood, even if we take motherhood merely as a physical function. The process of bearing a child culminates in a crisis which exhausts a woman’s energy : to such an extent, indeed, that women often die of it. Moreover, it is a process which, once initiated, is not under conscious control, so that the reserve of energy drawn upon is not deliberately assigned to this purpose by its owner. It is not at her free disposal to grant or to withhold ; it cannot be exhausted by an act depending on conscious volition. The race in this respect is stronger than the individual.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_18_0	It may be that here we are on the track of an essential difference between men and women in the distribution of energy. If fatherhood is a more casual relationship and uses up less time and energy than motherhood, it looks as if the specifically sexual life of men does not require such a jealously guarded reserve of energy as that of women. This would be true of all men and all women, for such a fundamental process as the propagation of the human race could not be left to a section of humanity. As far as the race is concerned, all women are potential mothers, and must have the necessary reserve of energy for this function whether they intend to become mothers ornot. They cannot waste it even if they would. Thus men have more energy to waste on their own individual purposes than women: that is to say, men have more energy at their conscious disposal.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_19_0	III
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_20_0	The implications of this hypothesis must be considered. It is attractive because it establishes an essential difference between men and women which makes them complementary to each other. There can be no question of absolute domination of one sex by the other when the strength of each lies in a different direction. If man’, energy is diverted more into conscious life, woman’, energy is diverted more into unconscious life, and one jg not more important than the other. It is a relative, not an absolute difference; both men and women are human beings, and all that concerns human beings is their joint affair. But it means, as will be seen, a difference in the kind of creative work done by each: they will tackle the same things from a different point of view, and with different results. On this basis men and women would each have an equal right, the right of the creative spirit to do its work without let or hindrance.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_21_0	Conscious life implies rational thinking. In thinking about things we arrange them in patterns, we give them form and system. But we do not give them content; conscious life modifies or seizes upon things which it does not originate. Growth is a process which is already well advanced before it enters consciousness at all. Our patterns of thought, therefore, can never be final: they must from time to time be broken and re-formed to admit new factors pushed into consciousness. But the existence of thought-patterns makes it easier to recognise the significance of new factors, since a thought, once formulated, can be passed on, and becomes a permanent heritage for the human race, part of the body of knowledge established by the processes of consciousness. ‘These processes are continuously at work extending the body of knowledge, systematising thought, and endeavouring to systematise life. Consciousness is thus the shaper of form, which is one as of life, and its work tends to a permanence beyond the vicissitudes of living. But — its vitality depends upon its communion with the unconscious. Pos
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_22_0	Obviously, unconscious life cannot be clearly defined. We can only guess at its nature from the angle at which its processes enter consciousness, from its disruptive action upon our systems of thought, and from what we can remember of its manifestations in dreams. We know that our emotions rise from it like bubbles through water, that it determines our motives and our interests, and that it is not homogeneous by conscious standards. Its interferences with our conscious life are always spontaneous and strongly charged with feeling. We can infer from such interferences that it has purposes. From its manifestations in dreams and trance states we know that it has access to knowledge by other then conscious means. ‘This kind of knowledge, when it makes its way into comsciousness, we sometimes recognise by its emotional force and unexpectedness, and call it intuition. But for the most part we serve the purposes of our unconscious without knowing that we do so, and admit its wisdom only through the indirect channels of conscious rationalisation.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_23_0	The processes of the unconscious can, however, be roughly described by contrast with the conscious life. The unconscious is concerned with growth rather than form; it is essentially emotional, spontaneous, and irrational. As far as we know, it is concrete in its thinking and not abstract ; it creates living agents and not systems of thought. Thus, while conscious processes supply form and permanence in our world, unconscious processes supply growing vitality and change. ‘The creations of unconscious life are wrought in mortal substances, those of conscious life in enduring patterns which are one step removed from life. Unconscious life creates, for example, human beings: conscious life creates, for example, philosophy. If men are stronger in conscious life, and women in unconscious life, their creative powers must express their strength. Men should excel in translating life into conscious forms, women in fostering the growth of life itself. Men will create systems of philosophy or government, while women are creating individual human beings.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_24_0	IV
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_25_0	The facts of human life tend to confirm this theory, Starting again from the fundamental relationship of a mother to her child, we can see that owing to the peculiar position of the human race, the physical act of motherhood is only the merest beginning of motherhood as a function. Man, because he is destined for a more complex life than the other animals, is born more helpless than any of them, and takes a longer time to come to maturity. His conscious life constructs itself slowly out of the perceptions of every day, establishing at every point in its development a working relationship with his unconscious life, a relationship which is permanently biassed by the experiences of his first years. He is terribly at the mercy of his mother. She can ruin or strengthen that harmony between the conscious and the unconscious which is a necessary condition of full human development. - In short, she must create not only a human body, but a human being, if she is to fulfil her function as a mother. But if it is her business to foster growth in her children, it must be equally her business to foster growth in all the people with whom she is intimate. If she is a specialist in the needs of the growing human spirit, her peculiar knowledge must be of service to men and women of all ages who are still capable of growth. And what is true in this respect of mothers must
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_25_1	be true for all women : a special equipment for motherhood does not descend suddenly by the grace of Heaven upon the individual. All girls are potential mothers, and whatever gifts of intuition are necessary for the creative work of motherhood must be accessible to all women. If the full content of motherhood is thus recognised, it must inevitably be recognised as a special application of the creative power ofwomen. Therefore the concept “ superfluous Women ” can only arise in a society which denies the real functions of motherhood, and which consequently prevents women from free expression and ignores the creative power of womanhood.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_26_0	Creative power of any kind is, of course, the obverse of an equal power for destruction. No one can put an engine out of action so deftly as the man who designs engines. Woman’s power of fostering growth in human. life implies, therefore, an equal power of hindering it. We must accept both sides of the hypothesis, and in doing so we find fresh proof that it is true. If the average man sees woman alternately as an angel and a devil, it is because she exercises both a creative and a destructive influence upon his inner life. He would neither fear nor reverence her so intensely if she were merely an inferior counterpart of himself. Nor would he lay upon her such peculiar disabilities. These disabilities are not only of the kind that would suffice to keep an inferior class in subjection. Inferior classes, whether actually enslaved or not, are kept in their place by being excluded from the sources of external power, such as the possession of wealth, the command of armies, the exercise of political rights. Certain moral and religious sanctions always rise to reinforce the law on these points, for the springs of human conduct lie in the unconscious, and morality and religion deal directly with the emotions of unconscious life. The Tuling class seeks therefore to impose a morality consonant with its own interests, and fears a new religion more than arevolution. But it is always conscious of the expediency of the conventional morality it
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_26_1	imposes on inferiors, and attaches no ultimate value to it. The model subordinate, obedient and loyal, is not reverenced or idealised : he is not regarded by his superiors as a type of perfect manhood, but only as a perfect subordinate. He may be a bad man provided that he is a good servant. The position of women in a men’s State does not correspond exactly to this. True, if we substitute the function of motherhood in its narrow interpretation for the function of servitude, the correspondence is exact up to a point, The wife and mother is excluded from independent access to the sources of external power : and she is expected to be obedient and loyal to her marriage contract. Moral and religious sanctions are called in to transform her marriage contract into a vow. The stock moral virtue required of her is chastity ; she must have sexual relationships only within the pale of marriage. All women, because they are potential wives, must copy her virtues and avoid what is forbidden to her. So far this is only another aspect of the fact that men restrict the function of women to physical motherhood, and define their own responsibilities by the institution of marriage. Women are treated exactly as an inferior class with a definite function, that of child-bearing. But the correspondence stops here. The disabilities imposed upon women by conventional morality cut deeper still. The sexually good woman must be not only good but ignorant : whole
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_26_2	tracts of human experience are withheld from her knowledge. Moreover, her chastity and her ignorance are translated by men themselves into an abstraction of artificial purity and reverenced as their ideal of womanhood. An ideal of womanhood cherished in men’s States, which has for its essential elements ignorance of life and a debased conception of sex, can be regarded with scepticism. It is noteworthy that intellectual ignorance does not have the same prestige, and therefore cannot be so important. Even an “educated” woman 1s conventionally more acceptable than a woman who is shocked at nothing. The conventionally pure good woman is shocked at a great many things: that is to say, she does not merely condemn certain phases of conduct, which would be at least a forthright attitude, she is uncomfortable and timid when they are brought to her notice.. Now if man’s reverence for women is an acknowledgment of her vaguely realised power, at the same time in that very reverence, conventionalised into an ideal, he obviously safeguards himself against her power. Apparently, women can be kept in a subordinate position if ignorance of human conduct is imposed upon them as a necessary condition of social approval. It can be inferred that a fearless attitude towards human life is the first essential quality of a free woman, and that conventional morality is imposed with such emphasis upon women because the creation of moral values is their own peculiar vocation. Men are more concerned to prevent women from having untrammelled
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_26_3	judgment and action in affairs of morality than from having access to the possession of wealth. In other words, women are hindered not only from external power, but from the inward power of creating independent moral and religious values. It is precisely this power which is exercised by creative women in their treatment of others, and the conventionalised ideal of the ignorant good woman is the deepest disability laid upon women in amen’s State. The conventionally good woman helps to perpetuate the formal traditions created by man, traditions which harden into empty shells unless they are continuously vitalised by the independent judgments of women. She accepts the masculine standpoint that human conduct is to be judged entirely by the values of consciously organised life, which are devised for the Preservation of existing systems, and are not necessarily humane, She acquiesces in repression and punishment instead of seeking to understand and cherish. Men praise her for this subserviency and unconsciously despise her. . :
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_27_0	But in preventing her from aggression upon their forms and traditions men lose more than they gain. She is humbugged out of her womanhood, but she is still a woman, and does not cease to influence their inner life. The systems of society — such as marriage—are preserved, but the individual man suffers. He meets hardnes where he looks for tolerance, and condemnation wliavs he needs help. Worse still, for her conventionality is borrowed and therefore unintelligent, he finds himself imprisoned in traditions which he himself would destroy and create anew were it not for the timidity of the conventional women.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_28_0	Thus in a typical men’s State where the creative work of women is ignored, where women are prevented by legal and economic barriers from access to external sources of power and hampered by conventional ignorance of life, they have an insidious influence which evades all the means by which men try to keep it in check. The fabric of the State, the organised systems, remain apparently intact, but the private life of men becomes sour and stale. The more men deny the rights of women in public, the more they are delivered over to the obscure dissatisfactions of their women in private. The conventional women whom men evoke for their own protection have in the end a more fatal, because a thwarted, influence on human life than the fearless women. Among the Hindus, for example, where the social systems of men have hardened into cast-iron (perhaps because the women have been prevented from free expression), the negative power of women is very great. Women are not merely inferior imitations of men: they create men or destroy them.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_29_0	The question may be put, If the whole of human experience is the natural concern of women, and if women are indeed endowed with the capacity to understand and foster the growth of the human spirit, how is it possible for women to accept a narrow conventional morality? It is possible because unconscious life is remarkably suggestible, and in a society where womanly traditions are mainly negative the continuous pressure of conventional values is applied to girls almost from childhood. Only rare women with a genius for womanhood can resist the potency of such suggestions.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_30_0	That it is a woman’s destiny to create human be whether she fulfils it or not, is amply confirmed b natural bias of her interests. In spite of convention her interest in human beings is stronger and more spontaneous than her interest in anything else. Almost from the cradle a girl studies the people around her more attentively than a boy does, and is quicker in imitating their tricks of speech and behaviour, A little later she turns naturally to dolls, not because of an absurdly precocious maternal instinct, but because dolls are substitutes for human beings, and her creative fancy can play upon them Without restriction. A doll is not necessarily a son or daughter : it is by turns a confidant, a scapegoat, and a talisman. Later still her interest in other people becomes practically a ruling passion : and since she is not merely a potential wife and mother but a potential woman, she is interested not only in possible sweethearts but in everybody. She is inquisitive about human relationships of every kind. She is indifferent to things which have no human interest : she values things for their associations, or the power they give her over other people. The intimacy between an adolescent girl and her bosom friend for the time being is based on a mutual interest in human nature and a common standard of critical values which they apply to each other as well as to the world. They analyse motives, provoke moods, love
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_30_1	and hate with such intensity that emotional explosions are inevitable. ‘Their interest is not that of mere spectators at the human comedy: they are ready to play important parts in it ; and they test at every point their influence over others.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_31_0	When fifteen-year-old girls write essays on “ What I should like to be,” the aspirations disclosed are rarely intellectual or material. Nearly every girl wants to be Popular, to be an influence for good, to establish a reputation for cheerfulness and kindness, in short, to be successful in handling human beings. When she leaves school the same bias continues. The average girl is more interested in the people around her than in her work, especially if her work has little direct human interest. If her daily work does not consist of personal relations to other people, her efficiency in it depends upon the approval of her employers rather than upon her pride in the work itself. She sees herself as the sunbeam in the office, or as the comforter of her employer’s broken life, or as a moral influence—in other words, where no human interest exists in her surroundings she takes pains to invent it. It is this entirely womanly impulse which generates most of the sentiment and scandal among women.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_32_0	In married life women display the same passionate interest in other people, even though husbands and families absorb a certain amount of it. Neighbours, servants, and children are their dearest topics. No woman is bored when she is discussing other people ; and this is true of both educated and uneducated women. The things which primarily concern women as women are human affairs and experiences, material which helps them more capably to scrutinise, to interpret, and to meddle with the people they meet. The result is that they often meddle tediously with other people’s lives. Like Hedda Gabler, they must have their fingers in somebody’s destiny, destructively if not creatively. Destruction of this kind instead of creation is tragic, but it arises at least from a pre-occupation with humanity, and so, unlike war, it is womanly.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_33_0	Thus the current of women’s interests sets definitely towards actual human beings and concrete situations rather than abstract theories. There are other aspects of womanhood which confirm the hypothesis that women’s strength lies in unconscious rather than in conscious life and which can be briefly enumerated.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_34_0	The first of these is too obvious to require comment. By general consent of men, women are more irrational and impulsive than men are. Secondly, women have a strong, if inarticulate, affinity with what is called Nature ; a fact which is symbolised by the personification of Nature as a woman. Nature in this sense is the sum of that growing life which has not reached the conscious level of humanity. To this growing life, vegetable or animal, women are never indifferent: their reactions to it are strongly emotional, whether sympathetic or antipathetic. When because of some timidity they cannot exercise their creative power on human beings, they readily foster plants or animals instead, and there are women who can do so with the sureness of intuitive knowledge. They are more obviously affected by natural phenomena than men; their sexual life, for example, is governed by the phases of the moon, and it is claimed that their fertility varies with the rainfall and the earth’s magnetic currents. Thirdly, they have an immediate sense of the significance of life : they have the same vivid interest in even trivial affairs that one finds in dreams. Women have none of the detachment which is equally prepared to prove that life is significant or that it is meaningless. They assume without proof that life, especially human life, is significant ; they are so deeply immersed in life that it is not possible for them to question its value as men do. For this
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_34_1	reason they are more tenacious of life than men. Fourthly, they come to maturity earlier than men do, although they live longer on the average. ‘This does not mean that women remain in a state of arrested development as compared with men: the advent of puberty does not put a stop to mental and spiritual development. But it may be interpreted as a sign that the creative work of womanhood requires a less elaborate conscious equipment than that of men. ‘The wisdom of conscious life is a structure slowly built by the individual, and needs a long apprenticeship ; it is possible that the wisdom of unconscious jif, exists independently of the individual and waits only for admission. Incidentally, the fact that women have , reasonable expectation of living for twenty-five years after they have ceased to bear children is another proof— if proof be needed—that maternity is not merely q physical function: women go on living as long as their childrenneedthem. Lastly, although their creative work consists in the handling of individuals, and although they are finely aware of their own individual reactions, women rarely achieve a conscious individuality. They are so largely unconscious of themselves that they need emotional support for their personalities: it is their danger that they tend to live in a state of perpetual reference to other people ; and when they express themselves as individuals, they do so spontaneously and not deliberately. Thus women as a body show a timidity which easily relapses into
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_34_2	conservatism, and can only be overcome by urgent necessity. Conservatism becomes the spiritual death of women, as of men: but in women it springs from a timidity of intellect, from a weakness in conscious life ; in men from a timidity of emotion, from a fear of the unconscious. This difference between men and women is illustrated in dress, for example. As the consciously organised life of men develops, their clothing expresses less of the emotion, the temperament, the spontaneity of unconscious life: it becomes a uniform, symbolic of their status as rational members of an organised society. They are sure of themselves and of their traditions, consequently fashion is a convention which sits as easily upon them as other conventions, and changes as slowly. It is a reasonable law, deliberately accepted for the sake of convenience and orderliness. Women, on the other hand are not afraid of temperament and colour in dress ; they express in their clothing the spontaneous, vivid, and irrational qualities of veg life. But because they are unsure are of themselves as members of a public body, are < the assurance of “‘ being in the fashion ” to they hee the necessary confidence for wearing even the ae daring creations. Fashion among women is thus i a law accepted for convenience; it is a kind of emotional support, and it fluctuates as often and as widely as emotions.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_35_0	V
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_36_0	In this weakness of women’s conscious life we have the key to men’s domination over them. It is the domination of the more articulate over the less articulate consciousness. Man is the intellectual organiser of life. He arranges life in patterns, or, as has been already suggested, translates it into conscious forms, and he is therefore more interested in the nature of his patterns than in the material out of which he composes them. He begins, where woman ends, with the individual human being and individual experiences ; his aim is to lift these into a world of enduring and proved forms. The Platonic idea, for example, is a purely masculine conception. It is possible that man’s world of ultimate abstractions is another aspect of the world from which woman works towards the individual, and that his consciously constructed philosophy, if it were perfected, would coincide with the content of her intuitive wisdom. Thus a circle would be completed in which woman seeks to express the infinite in terms of the individual life, while man seeks to express the individual in terms of the infinite. The difference between them remains, however, not merely a difference in aim but a difference in equipment. Woman is the gateway through which the wisdom of the unconscious comes to be translated by man into conscious form. Her wisdom, derived from unfathomable sources, must be expended upon incarnate and narrowed into the practical details of everyday circumstance. Her intelligence is fettered, as it were, to
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_36_1	actual life, and is best stimulated by concrete situations. Man, on the other hand, moves away from human life: his intelligence ranges freely in a world of speculation and can create perfectly abstract universes of knowledge. His work consequently takes visible shape beneath his hand: it can be tested; it can be destroyed and shaped again; it can achieve completion. The work of woman has none of these attributes: she has no objective proof of success; in the last resort she must depend upon her subjective valuations. ‘Thus the more organised and objective certainties of men impose themselves easily upon women. Men can prove their theories even when they are wrong ; women cannot prove their intuitions even when they are right. In his world, that of organised form, man dominates woman naturally.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_37_0	But woman should dominate man in her own field, the creation of free and harmonious individuals; for the potential progress of humanity may be determined by man, but its actual progress is determined by woman. In a society. which recognises the domination of men and denies that of women, the creative work of both 1s hampered. The danger for men lies in that very quality of detachment which gives their work its value. Left to themselves they become more and more detached, substituting for the fluctuations of life a stable and systematic perfection of theory which is rigidly imposed upon individual members of society. Religion becomes a creed, morality a code of law, government a party machine: even art, which is of all their activities the most accessible to the vitality of unconscious life, is intellectualised and engenders theories of aesthetics instead of works of art. Human beings become mere pegs on which to hang the theories, economic units, and man, the heir of all the ages, is in danger of being crushed under the weight of his own machines. The financial machine in our own day is an excellent example of masculine activity pushed to extremes : it has been successfully detached. from human values so that it exists for the production of money and not for the production of goods and services to humanity. The mere individual has ceased to be of any importance, and even the inventions or discoveries of his intelligence are valued only in terms
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_37_1	of money. It is a curious paradox that men who, as individuals, are surer of themselves than women, and who command their conscious energies more freely, should inevitably create systems to which the individual is subordinated. A system of this kind is not necessarily an evil, but when it makes no allowance for women’s values, for their sense of the significance of human life and the individual human being, it moves to its extreme logical conclusion and becomes inhuman.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_38_0	This over-emphasis of masculine activities was conceivably necessary at a point in history when civilisation was in its infancy and the need for organisation was greater than the need for individual freedom. Perhaps at such a point the domination of men over women began. But the discrepancy between human and institutional values ls how so great that even men feel it acutely ; it has disquieted women for some time and is forcing them into the open. It looks as if during the next few generations the really creative New Woman will emerge, for conventional morality is no longer so powerful among women, and they are gradually deserting the blind alleys into which they rushed in their first efforts at self-assertion.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_39_0	It does not follow that women by themselves can save humanity. Men must face their own problems, and women are naturally ill-equipped to create new forms of society. But it is the business of women to create the creators of social forms, and they cannot escape a certain responsibility for the present tension in our organised life. Absolute domination by either sex is no longer necessary; the modern world needs the creative work of both. Woman by herself loses a sense of proportion, just fe man by himself loses touch with reality. Man’s intellectual conclusions must be checked by woman, intuitive knowledge of the human spirit, and woman’; spontaneous wisdom must be helped by man’s intellectual vision. Both are creative although they depend upon each other: there is no room on either side for false pride or humility.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_40_0	VI
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_41_0	It is now advisable to consider attentively the statement that creative women need new and independent moral values since conventional morality expresses a man’s standpoint rather than a woman’s. If the latter part of this statement can be proved, that conventional morality is necessarily masculine, then the first part must inevitably be accepted.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_42_0	It has already been postulated that women derive their greatest strength from unconscious life and are concerned with growth. Their energies and interests turn spontaneously towards the living human beings upon whom their influence is exerted. This influence, because it is largely unconscious, is not rational but emotional ; when it 1s directed positively towards other people it is best described as love. Creative love is the fundamental attribute of womanhood, as perhaps creative thought is of manhood. Its aim is to foster harmony and strength in the individual.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_43_0	Woman thus sees humanity as a collection of individuals of whom no two are identical, growing separately like trees in a common direction, expressing in visible forms, each of which is significant, a common unseen life. If one may use a rough symbolism, women see humanity in vertical lines, while men see it in horizontal strata. The
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_44_0	perfection of each individual is women's business, and the combination of individuals into social systems is man’s business. These two aspects of life are necessarily continuous and inseparable: the difference between them here, as throughout, is one of emphasis. Women emphasise the wholeness of the individual in himself; men, the relation of the individual to his neighbours. It follows that women cannot disregard or eliminate anything which manifests itself in the life of the individual. Man resembles a tree only by analogy ; he cannot be lopped of his branches ; he can achieve strength and harmony only by carrying everything with him. Nothing is accidental or superfluous in his behaviour; virtues and vices are alike significant. From this point of view whatever prevents the harmony of the complete individual is bad ; but it cannot be cut off, it must be fused into the whole, if possible. Woman therefore cannot shirk any issue or turn from the investigation of all that life which passes into human consciousness, and to her goodness and badness are relative terms, depending on the nature of the immediate problem. Thus she cannot believe in original sin, although she recognises mistakes. Man, on the other hand, believes in the significance of his systems which cut across life horizontally, and he desires to fit the individual into his patterns. Whatever disrupts his patterns is bad and must be cut off. This condition naturally is uniform in its operation, and therefore badness is a constant quantity, something
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_44_1	definite which can be written down in a code of prohibitions. Nonconformity with with the law is original sin, and arouses his indignation. But there are many systems, each system has its own code of offences and penalties, and each casts out its own offenders. The Church excommunicates them, the State imprisons them, Society boycotts them, professional bodies expel them; they are dishonoured and ignored, thrust out of the system whose stability they threaten. We penetrate to the very heart of the difference between men and women when we observe that the outcast, whose individuality is formally denied by his fellows, remains none the less an individual to the women who love him. Obviously a morality which satisfies the one point of view does not satisfy the other.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_45_0	The morality honoured by men is thus a morality designed to preserve the systems which men create. Because it upholds the values of consciously organised life it distrusts the impulses of unconscious life, which it calls original sin, or personifies as a devil. Less civilised and more impulsive races are easily suspected of being direct agents of the devil, as are also the adherents of rival or opposing systems. Women, because they are natural supporters of spontaneous action, are particularly to be distrusted, and masculine morality, as we have seen, imposes a still more stringent code on women than on men. So it happened that Eve, a creative woman vindicating the importance of individual moral values and of an individual conscience that should make each man the equal of God, was necessarily abhorrent to an organised theology. So in the United States it happens that the earnest business man regards negroes and Socialists as public dangers ; and in exactly the same way in Scotland the earnest Calvinist believes that Roman Catholics are damned. The follower of a systematic morality has always a black list. Each system produces its own code of offences for nonconformity, and its moral standards are therefore valid only for itself: they are not necessarily religious or universal.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_46_0	In such a morality the individual is considered only as one who conforms or does not conform to the code required, never as an individual in himself. Further, because it distrusts the spontaneity of unconscious impulses, systematic morality believes that all individuals are bad in their hearts, that they are good only when they are afraid to be bad, and that penalties for badness must be sufficiently grievous to frighten them. Thus systematic morality depends upon fear of punishment. The kind of punishment imposed has only an arbitrary relation to the nature of the offence committed, and no relation at all to the psychological problems in which the offender is involved: it is designed merely to make him suffer, and, if he persists in offending, to remove him. The public school imposes its two hundred or its four hundred “ines? or so many strokes with the birch, or resorts to expulsion ; the State fines varying sums, or imprisons for varying periods, or resorts to capital punishment; the business firm reprimands, or fines, or resorts to dismissal. In each case the system and the code which supports it are more important than the life of the individual. Morality of this kind, when it is perfectly developed, is quite impersonal; its abstract impersonality is revered by men as an ideal, which they call Justice.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_47_0	This systematic morality with its impersonal judgments, its definite codes, its uniformly graded punishments, and its unquestioning repudiation of the offender is a logical pendant to the systems which men create. It is precisely what is usually called conventional morality, and it is essentially masculine in its attitude to the individual. Women, if they are to create free and harmonious individuals, cannot sacrifice an individual to a code ; they cannot agree that goodness is only the fear of punishment : they cannot believe in the efficacy of external punishment, and they cannot permit the offender to be cut off. To the creative woman an offender is a question which she must try to answer. Her morality must be psychological rather than punitive, personal rather than impersonal, and fundamentally religious. It is clear that many actions which systematic morality considers bad must appear good to the creative woman, and inversely what she considers good must often be condemned by systematic morality.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_48_0	Women must therefore create their own independent moral values. It may be objected that if each stoning creates her own morality the result will be confusion This objection, however, arises out of a misapprehension, It is not the business of women to condemn or to punish, or to exact conformity with any definite code of conduct : it is their business to understand the processes at work in the human soul and to help each individual to the fullest and most harmonious expression of his powers. There will always be enough men in the world to secure the existence of systematic morality; any confusion produced by the action of women will be only the rich confusion of life itself. Besides, creative love is not mere sympathy or even affection; if women cannot sacrifice an individual to a code they are equally unable to sacrifice their intuitions about the human race to an individual. Creative love demands a high discipline from those who would exercise it.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_49_0	VII
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_50_0	The first condition that is required from women is that they shall know themselves. ‘A woman who is ignorant of her own weaknesses cannot help others, for she is incapable of correcting distortions caused by her own fear or anger. ‘The conventional woman hangs conventional ideas between herself and her own nature, thus negating her deepest instincts. She despises and represses part of her own humanity ; consequently she has a repressive instead of a fostering effect on other eople. Women must therefore be frankly sincere with themselves if they are to be creative, and must make allowances for their own faults in dealing with others. One can only mete out to others the measure one has already meted out to oneself.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_51_0	But though the instrument is imperfect the possibilities are great. ‘The second condition for the exercise of creative love is a boundless faith in the capacity of the human soul for growth, ‘This is where women cannot let the doctrine of original sin stand between them and the individuals with whom they have to deal. The gospel for women is contained in the words, “ the kingdom of Heaven is within you,” qualified by the knowledge that Heaven is not a static condition of bliss but a vital harmony of body and spirit. Such a belief demands the fullest scientific knowledge of what promotes or hinders health of body and of mind ; and it is the business of the creative woman to get all the information she can.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_52_0	Religion and morality for women thus resolve themselves into a belief that human life is significant, serving a destiny greater than itself, and the interpretation of that belief into terms of conduct. Because each individual is a unique problem the details of this conduct can never be codified ; therefore the morality of women is ultimately spontaneous and individual, depending for guidance upon their creative energies, expressed through love.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_53_0	The whole world needs creative women, and seems to be unaware of its need. Women themselves do not know how necessary they are. The result is that many waste themselves in trying to be men, and many are content to justify their existence by simple drudgery. There still remain many who feel that a woman should be more to her husband than the keeper of his house, and some of these reserve themselves for men with obvious disabilities, because they think that the average man has no real need of them, But, although the desire 1s unformulated, nearly all women desire to have a creative influence on. their husbands. If it were not so, the ‘ best-sellers which circulate among women would not resemble each other so strikingly in one respect : the hero is always at odds with the world and is rescued from a gloomy fate by the great love of the heroine. If he is a reputed villain so much the better the field of action for the heroine is all the clearer. Only a courageous woman looking for really dificult work would marry an ordinary man instead of a villain with a heart of gold.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_54_0	Women’s creative work is implicitly recognised in many beliefs and customs. The difference between the morality of men and women, for example, is finely illustrated among the Syrian Arabs, where a prisoner on his way to execution is absolved from his sentence if he can lay hold of a woman’s skirts. It is felt, though not understood, by those men of our own country who complain that women have no sense of justice. It is exploited by commercial firms who establish women welfare workers to humanise their business systems, within limits. And the tradition that woman’s place is the home is possibly not entirely determined by the subordinate position of women, but may arise from a sound intuition about the nature of women and their functions. The home is a strategic centre for the creation of human beings. Moreover, a home does not imply a husband: marriage is a desirable but not a necessary condition for women’s creative work. Nor is it bounded by the four walls of a house ; whatever affects the people within the home is a woman’s proper business.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_55_0	VIII
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_56_0	This raises the question of public life for women. There is certainly room for creative womanhood in the public life of the State. The modern State is a highly organised system of government resting upon other systems, such as those of finance, law, and industry ; but these complicated organisations ramify downwards until they touch the lives of all the individuals who compose the nation. The point at which they do so is a fitting point for the public activities of women. Women have already begun to mediate between the system of law and the individuals upon whom punishment by imprisonment is imposed; they have called attention to the impossibility of reforming offenders in a prison which ignores individuality and the psychology of the individual It is true that such mediation is at present usually subject to the veto of the controlling system, and is therefore limited ; a disability which is likely to hamper women until the value of women’s work is recognised as equal to that of men. But the obscure dissatisfactions of our time, caused by the discrepancy between institutional and human values are, on the one hand, compelling women to penetrate into public life, and, on the other hand threatening the stability of all institutions. If women are true to themselves their full co-operation with men is inevitable.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_57_0	This means that women must carry their womanhood with them into all occupations, otherwise the advantage of their entry into public affairs will be entirely lost. Besides, a woman who tries to do a man’s work in a man’s way pays too high a price for the effort. A man can be formal and abstract without losing his human qualities or ceasing to be creative, since his energies are distributed in that way, but a woman cannot. She must expend more energy than he does to achieve the same formal outlook ; she must abandon the creative love for the individual which is essential for womanhood ; and, because she has killed herself spiritually, a formal woman is twice as formal as any man, and her work is necessarily barren. Most women are instinctively aware of this danger and protect themselves from the hardening of traditional routine by simple indifference to their work and an escape into marriage as soon as possible. But this is an evasion of the problem which women must solve in the next generation or two, the problem of leaving the organised systems of society with human values so that mechanical routine is reduced to a minimum. Meanwhile, women are obviously in their proper place in any occupation which deals directly with human beings.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_58_0	IX
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_59_0	The differences that have been indicated between the sexes in this essay do not form a hard-and-fast dividing line. Men are not all intellect and consciousness, nor are women all intuition and unconsciousness. It would be juster to say that some men are more intellectual than any woman, and some women more intuitive than any man: but even this statement does not adequately cover the case. The different determination of energy which hinders women from supreme intellectual detachment, and men from supreme human understanding, is subtly operative between these two extremes throughout the intervening space where men and women have a common field of action. It should therefore be traceable in their respective contributions to art.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_60_0	It is perhaps unwise though interesting to attempt the drawing of distinctions between men’s art and women’s: so much depends upon one’s idea of the nature of art. But it may be possible without becoming entangled in controversy to suggest tentatively some differences, and it seems worth while to see how far the argument wi carry us.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_61_0	From the point of view of this inquiry a work of art ranks as a supremely conscious creation. It has perfection of form and it is permanent : ars longa, vita brevis. But it is also directly and vitally connected with the forces of unconscious life ; it depends upon, or rather it is characterised by an intensity of emotion which it transmits as if by magic to other people than its creator. Its form can be judged dispassionately, but not its content. It is detached from human life, a is at the same time a revelation of it in a way which is more immediate and more moving than a mere explanation. Thus, although it is as deliberate a product of conscious processes or a mathematical theory or a philosophical idea, or an economic system, it is more intimately linked to unconscious life than any of these; it is perhaps closer to unconscious life than any other kind of conscious creation. For this reason, because it belongs to both worlds, the esteem in which it is held varies according to the values of the people among whom it is practised. And in certain cases the place assigned to art seems to confirm the general theory of this essay, that women create unconscious more than conscious life, and that men associate the values of unconscious life with women. For in communities which are too rigidly organised, because entirely devoted to some system, and which therefore distrust the personal values of
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_61_1	unconscious life, communities such as those of the business men here or in the United States, art is distrusted, the artist is considered to be effeminate, and the appreciation and culture of art are left half contemptuously, half respectfully to the women. On the other hand, in communities where the framework of conscious life has not hardened and unconscious values are not depreciated, the formal perfection of art arouses men’s admiration, and the artist is looked upon as the best type of manhood. The artist must thus possess both masculine and feminine qualities ; that is to say, he has immediate access to the intuitions of unconscious life, as a woman has, and he creates conscious form, as a man does.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_62_0	It has already been admitted that the difference between men and women is only a relative difference, that men have unconscious and women conscious powers; the fact that art belongs to both worlds therefore allows both men and women to be artists, while at the same time it makes more difficult than ever the attempt to draw a distinction between men’s art and women’s. There are however, one or two possibilities which suggest themselves. In the first place, if the energy of women is more absorbed by unconscious life than that of men, it can play less freely in the world of conscious form and is therefore less able to achieve that perfect fusion of form and content on a grand scale which is supreme art. Certainly the greatest artists of historical times have been men, and there is no reason to think that the domination of men is even partly responsible for the lack of great women artists. But if women are handicapped in those arts, such as literature, painting, and the composition of music, where the finished product takes a permanent form detached from the human personality of the artist, they should have an advantage in arts like dancing, singing, and acting, where the actual personality is the medium of expression. And as a matter of fact in arts of this kind women have attained supreme rank. It seems permissible to say that the nearer they are to concrete human life, the more freely and naturally they can
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_62_1	create. Again, it may be suggested that the tendency to elaborate form at the expense of content is a danger to which men are more susceptible in art than women. Women’s greater vitality and comparative weakness in conscious life expose them rather to the opposite fault, a failure to achieve a strictness of form perfectly adequate to the intensity of the emotion expressed. This weakness would be more likely to occur in the rendering of a sustained than of a transient emotion or mood; consequently one would expect perfection of form from women artists in works of small compass and natural spontaneity, such as lyric poems, rather than in an epic or a long descriptive poem. ‘The more elastic the form, the more shapeless it is, the more women are able to use it for sustained work. In literature, at least, this seems to be true. The loose bulk of the novel makes it attractive to women as a medium of expression ; and any long works of the first rank written by women are to be found in this form.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_63_0	Further, since it is women’s business to create individuals rather than systems of society, one would expect the art of women to be concerned largely with actual individual experience and concrete situations. In one sense, of course, all art must do this; but individual experience can be transmuted into symbols and so generalised, or projected into future worlds, and that is precisely what women are unlikely to do. No woman has ever written a great myth or a Utopia.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_64_0	Finally, if women are essentially creators of human life, we may surmise that they are more interested in the relation of art to life than in art for art’s sake. But this supposition must be made with many qualifications. It is not suggested that in the act of creating or appreciating a work of art women pause to ask, “ Of what use is this to life?” If the emotion that they experience is authentic and vivid they will accept its significance simply, as they accept the significance of any vivid experience. But it is suggested that if they reflect upon art at all, this is precisely the question, formulated or not, which will decide their attitude to it. In estimating a work of art women are more likely to be influenced by its content than by its form, and they are capable of drawing practical conclusions from it which would occur to men. sighs the different kinds of art, those which express themselves in a medium closely related to the normal activities of daily life seem to be the most favourable for women. There are more great women artists in literature ¢han in sculpture or painting, and more in these than in music. “Literature 1s expressed through language, which is a medium in constant use between individuals ; a paint brush in our civilisation is a less usual means of expression, and the making of music still less usual. One might also hazard a guess that in literature the
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_64_1	vocabulary of women contains fewer unusual words than that of men. For the difference between spoken and written language is roughly analogous to the difference between women and men; 4 correspondence which may influence the style of women both as speakers and writers and their preferences as readers.
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_65_0	X
1-10-women-inquiry	doc_25_66_0	It may be affirmed, then, that women are more directly linked to concrete life than men, and that they naturally incline to utilitarian standards in judging the importance of things. Men create ideas, and women make use of them: women create human beings, and men: make use of them: both men and women seize what they need for the service of their own purposes. Is this difference discernible in the intellectual work of educated women, in the subjects they deliberately choose for research, and in the contributions they make to knowledge? ‘This question, and many others, remain to be answered ; and, with them, the fundamental question whether the education of women, and especially their “ higher education,” is planned to secure the development of an enlightened womanhood, as distinct from manhood. ‘The present inquiry pretends to be nothing more than a stimulus to the further investigation of essential differences between men and women ; but it is clear that if there is any truth in our conclusions, an honest re-statement of women’s aims is necessary. ‘The conception of womanhood which has been adumbrated here, if it is accepted, demands so many adjustments in the attitude of women towards themselves, towards morality, religion, sex, and education that it is impossible within the limits of this essay to give even a hint of them.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_0_0	ANOTHER FUTURE OF POETRY
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_1_0	Mr ROBERT TREVELYAN has forestalled me in his little book Thamyris, or Is there a Future for Poetry ? But I find his judgments for the most part so parochial, and his style so unadventurous, that in spite of the wide applause he has won from the elder critics, I am not deterred from signing a minority report at variance with his. Mr J. B. S. Haldane also, in his Daedalus ; or the Future of Science, has a few lines to spare for the future of Poetry; and it would be well to treat of the views of both these writers before making an independent forecast.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_2_0	Mr Trevelyan’s chief concern is the change that has come over poetry since it ceased to be chanted or sung, and began a new life as the spoken, written, or printed line. Now these are important changes if not particularly new ones. The regular chanting or singing element in poetry had already begun to disappear in mediaeval times, and except as a small and somewhat extravagant cult no longer survives, because it has been discovered that speech, particularly under emotion, though it does not employ the pure diatonic scale, has a music of its own which can be as agreeable as it is complex; and the chanting of modern poetry, so far from giving it richer life, has in my experience the exact opposite effect : the chant is seldom more than a self-conscious and lugubrious drone. The change from the chanted or spoken to the written or printed line is also no novelty, dating back as it does behind the invention of printing to the great copying schools of the ancient world; these circulated books far more freely among the cultured classes than is now realised. But the effects on poetry of this change grow yearly more apparent, Books get cheaper and more numerous, public recitations fewer; the Victorian habit of reading aloud in the home is dying ; poetic drama is on its last legs theatrically ; so that the spoken line is temporarily overshadowed by the printed line. True, poetry will never become a purely printed art,
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_2_1	for the poet is too fond of the sound of his voice; but unless new developments of broadcasting or a great simplification and improvement of the gramophone make it possible to listen to poetry with as great ease as one picks up a book of verse, the art of writing verse for the eye and the inner ear will progress, to the disadvantage of poetry composed for the outer ear. It is not enough to advise, as Mr Trevelyan does, that we should read with this inward ear and give the lines the same tempo as if they were being spoken. For poetry, when printed or written, has a unique character; though we may owe it to our ear to translate typography into sound, the importance of the first visual impact must not be sentimentally discounted for the sake of the singing tradition.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_3_0	There are startling variations in the acceptability of a poem, according to the style in which it is set down on the page. A poem type-written almost always looks unattractive. The conventions of setting down poetry are, as it were, the corridor through which we pass to the garden of imagination. If that corridor is white-tiled like the entrance to a public baths, or stuffy like the entrance to a museum, or postered like the entrance to a tube station, we enter the garden in the wrong frame of mind. The typewriter is, in my experience, still too commercial to serve as a proper introduction to the receptive imaginative mood.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_4_0	On the other hand, the original manuscript of a poem, to any reader who is at all sensitive to handwriting, will often give so much inside information as to the character and habits of the poet (far more than could be got by hearing the poet read the piece in question) that the oppression of personality in the handwriting may actually make it impossible to concentrate on the particular poem itself. There remains printing. But there is printing and printing. The habit, for instance, of printing English poetry in Italian types, or modern poems in old-English types, has a most confusing effect on the reader ; and there is no poem that cannot be made more dignified than it ever was before, or more vulgar than anyone could expect it had the power of being, by judicious choice of print and printer and paper.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_5_0	A small matter like the convention which gives a capital letter and a new line to every line of poetry is of immense importance. I never discovered how good Mr Sacheverell Sitwell’s poems were until he had consented to use the initial capital letter, after two books in which the lower case was used. And then spelling. Who will deny that Milton’s On a Solemn Musick, or Webster’s The White Divel, or Blake’s The Tyger get a powerful hold on our imaginations before we have even begun to read the poetry? Or who could read Keats’ St Agnes Eve in “‘simplifyd speling,” and still be entranced? ‘These startling effects do not correspond with any change of tone or accent in the spoken line, and there are therefore many who will protest that these effects have nothing to do with the poetry itself. But this is to insist sentimentally on the absolute priority of the spoken line. The fact is, poetry read silently and poetry spoken aloud are divergent arts; and we may summarise their different characters as follows:
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_6_0	In the first place, the outward ear has a far shorter memory than the conjunction of eye and inward ear. It readily forgets end-rhymes separated by more than three intervening lines, unusual words recurring at a longish interval, and structural sign-posts of various kinds ; but it has a far greater sensitivity to the variation of vowel and consonant, to internal rhyme, and to awkward con. currence of consonants (technically called “ syzygy”), notice in Mr Turner’s recent Landscape of Cytherea more than a few awkwardness of syzygy in contexts where 4 harmonious flow is intended. “ Sun’s shadow,” “ soul's gullies strewn,” “ frost’s cascade,” “ these shadows shone,” “ rocks spring,” occur on a single page; and there are rhymes separated by nine and ten lines. As pee for silent reading, both these irregularities are quite legitimate, the inward ear can and naturally does slur over its syzygal difficulties, and as the eye reads faster than the voice speaks, the rhyme-echo does not die away so quickly: but as spoken poetry the poem would be severely handicapped.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_7_0	The next obvious difference is that poetry of simple content can become very significant when spoken. The same poem, printed, is intellectually negligible, and one is tempted to say, “ My ear deceived me”; whereas poetry of highly concentrated content is impossible to hear with enjoyment until it has been read and thoroughly digested by the eye. The eye is a very summary, shrewd, supercilious organ, as it were the Enquiries Clerk of the Mind, and cannot be bothered with a visiting poem that has no air of immediate distinction to commend it; and the beauty of a poem may lie — quite adventitiously, the Eye will claim — in the inflections of voice intended by the poet, inflections for which the printer has not yet discovered even an approximate notation. The ear is a much simpler and sympathetic official, and once buttonholed will often commend to the management what the eye would call a most undeserving case, for though the ear may be wilfully blind, the eye is inclined to deafness. The ear can never properly appreciate a difficult poem of remote reference, intricate structure, and unusual diction, For when a poem is printed it is always possible to refer back, to pause and puzzle, and still keep the continvity of rhyme alive. In the spoken poem there is no sich licence; once a spoken poem begins, its rhymeechoes and the rhyme of its parts are quite destroyed by any puzzling or interruption.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_8_0	The ear and eye are both fallible in their interpretations of the poet’s intentions, but in different ways. The ear may mishear words such as “all together” or “in deed,” as if they were “ altogether ” and “ indeed,” and make even wilder mistakes, particularly with proper names, and cannot readily distinguish, say, between discreet and discrete ; whereas the eye can go even farther astray, particularly in the mistaking of rhythm. A regular two-stress line like Swinburne’s Hertha can be read as a four-stress line, or vice versa. Even the careful examination of the context sometimes prevents the poet’s intention if it be, say, ironic or playful, from coming through, and I have given an instance in my Poetic Unreason of a passage in Shakespeare—
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_9_0	“ Passed there a buck this way? No, but two does,”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_10_0	being mistaken by the eye for an intentionally absurd non-sequitur where “ does” was read as a verb and not as a substantive.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_11_0	The future of Poetry then will be concerned for a start with the problem how the outward ear, which carries with it the inward eye, and the outward eye, which carries with it the inward ear, may be satisfied by the same poem equally. It is a problem partly of word-mechanics and partly of psychology. Onthe whole, the adjustment tends at present to be unfair to the ear. A striking exception is Mr Nicholas Vachel Lindsay, the American, whose verses are all primarily intended for recitation. They have a very bare look in print, and a directness of statement which the Enquiries Clerk finds positively Tustic ; but as Mr Lindsay himself recites them, they are strangely effective. A fair adjustment between written or spoken poetry is, I believe, possible once the demands of each are fully and equally realised. For instance, it may be desirable in the ear’s interest to allow time for a mental adjustment after, and even before, the use of an unusual word or one highly charged with reference, Tp Shakespeare’s
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_12_0	“It would rather, The multitudinous seas incarnadine,”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_13_0	there is a distinct pause made after “the multitudinous ” by the concurrence of two ss, and between “ seas” and “incarnadine ” there is again a tendency to give a slight pause, owing perhaps to the displacement of “ would ” from the word it governs.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_14_0	So also a modern poet, Mr Bertram Higgins, in his poem Ulysses in Ithaca, writes :
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_15_0	“ Robbed of its element of wet, And discrete on a dune,”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_16_0	where the unusual word “ discrete,” which has to be distinguished from “ discreet,” is given an introducing pause by the necessity of separating the d of “and” and the d of “ discrete,” and a following pause by the tendency to avoid putting a heavy stress on the word “on.” It must be noticed that these pauses, which have the effect almost of inverted commas, do to some extent help the ear to recognise, uninformed by the eye, that it is not the ordinary “discreet” which is being used. The details of this adjustment we may leave future poets to settle; and if ever they re-introduce, with a difference, the Alexandrian tricks of shaping poems in the form of wings, crosses, pyramids, and so on, and burying acrostics in them solely for the ingenious delight of the eye; or if they write poetry solely for public declamation, that is no concern of ours. Eye poetry and ear poetry are both worthy arts, if distinguished. At this point it must be observed that though the subsidiary senses — smell, touch, taste — are not the direct means by which we take in poetry, as inward senses they are most important vehicles of thought, and must be used to give completeness to the poetic life. ‘To return to Mr Trevelyan: he conducts an enquiry into the future of verse forms, and comes to the conclusion that anything may happen — but he sincerely hopes that it won’t. Several of his statements
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_16_1	puzzle me a good deal—for instance, this: ‘Blank verse is the oldest of our verse forms,’’ which is wildly unhistorical, even if, as Mr Trevelyan suggests oddly enough, Chaucer’s rhymed couplet can be so regarded. And again, “The conscious principle according to which English verse has been written from the time of Chaucer until recent years has been that of syllable counting”’; this is only true of one of the main strands of English poetry. It is true that this has been the principle of the cultured prosody imposed on English from the Continent, and productive of a great deal of noble verse; but the earlier native prosody, which takes small stock of syllables, reckoning instead musically by the stress-centres of the line and the time interval between them, has never been driven from popular poetry, and has frequently been adopted by poets of culture. The readiest examples of native prosody are to be found in nursery rhyme and country ballad :
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_17_0	Misty, moisty was the morn, Chilly was the weather ; There I met an old man, Dressed all in leather, Dressed all in leather Against the wind and rain, It was, how do you do ? and how do you do? And how do you do ? again.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_18_0	“There once was a man So vain and so proud, He walked on stilts To be seen by the crowd, Up above the chimney-pots, Tall as a mast, And all the people ran about Shouting till he passed,”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_19_0	“At Wednesbury there was a cocking, A match between Newton and Scroggin ; The colliers and nailers left work And all to old Spittle’s went jogging. To see this noble sport Many noblemen resorted, And though they had but little money Yet that little they freely sported,”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_20_0	Though the syllables in each case number most irregularly, nobody can deny that the pieces scan.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_21_0	In the earliest English verse these stress-centres (for often the stress is not on one syllable but, as in bow do you do? and how do you do? spread over two or three) are marked clearly by alliteration, ‘Anglo-Saxon verse is all alliterative and stressed, its syllables are uncounted. In the fourteenth century came William Langland, a contemporary of Chaucer’s, Though the most famous of the middle English poets to revive the Anglo-Saxon alliterative metre, he was by no means the only one. In the sixteenth century John Skelton, in my opinion one of the three or four outstanding English poets, though reducing the alliteration, adding thyme, and even using the lineal arrangement of rhyme-royal, wrote in the native style as often as in the Continental. In the seventeenth century, Shakespeare, who had been dominated at his first visit to London by the Continental prosody in vogue at the theatres, gradually re-discovered his popular inheritance, and developed the foppish blank verse that Surrey and Wyatt had brought from Italy into a metre in which both principles, native and Continental, interacted; it was a metre capable at times of stresses as turbulent as those in Beowulf, while at others it would still strut syllabically like a fine gentleman.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_22_0	The two principles of prosody correspond in a marked way with contrary habits of life, with political principles : the Continental, with the classical principle of preordained structure, law and order, culture spreading downwards from the educated classes—the feudal principle ; the native English, with what Mr John Ransom calls the Gothic principle, one of organic and unforeseen growth, warm blood, impulsive generosity and frightful error — the communal principle, thréatening the classic scheme from below. ‘The rare poets who have contrived to reconcile the two principles have always had, like Skelton and Shakespeare, one foot firmly planted in the aristocratic set and the other equally firmly in the crowd. The future of English prosody depends enormously on the outcome of the class antagonism that undoubtedly is now in full swing. A Red victory would bring with it, I believe, a renewal of the native prosody in a fairly pure form, as the White domination of the eighteenth century made for pure Classicism, and kept it dominant until the Romantic Revival, intimately connected with the French Revolution, re-introduced stress-prosody.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_23_0	Dr Scripture has made one very important point about classical prosody ; that it is tinged with what he calls the typographical fallacy, namely, that the space between printed letters and the space between printed words represent an actual time-interval, or at least that it is possible to divide a verse up into feet by driving wedges between syllables; whereas, excepting definite long pauses for ease or emphasis, poetry as spoken is really one continuous flow of the voice-stream, and when a sensitive instrument is set to record it, there is nothing of a regular rise and fall in the resultant wavy line drawn to indicate either syllables or feet; that most of English Classical poetry, while conforming typographically to the syllable counting principle and to the rigid dualism of « short or long ?” that goes with it, gets its quality from a far subtler musical scheme than that of an ordered sequence of approximately identical feet, iambs, dactyls and what not: that, in fact, the musical delight we derive from, say, Gray’s Elegy is not and never was one of elementary arithmetic, but is based really on the variance of distance, pitch, and sonority between what custom arithmetically marks of as identical feet. This is not to deny the legitimacy of thinking in syllables. A syllable is a useful convention, and its adoption in classical poetry has led to the calming and slowing down of rhythm, suitable for grave and reflective thought. Its neglect, in the prosody of
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_23_1	stresscentres, has made for fury and ecstasy.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_24_0	This brings us to Mr ‘Trevelyan’s account of vers libre. He writes “ success of ‘ free verse ’ is in proportion to the’ degree in which we are made aware of a fixed metrical base underlying the irregularities. But what are we to think of this kind of thing ?—
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_25_0	“Come, my songs, let us express our baser passions. Let us express our envy for the man with a steady job and no worry about the future.’ ”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_26_0	He comments: “ But it would almost seem that at times free verse is no more than an excuse for uttering futilities and ineptitudes that we should not have dared to express in honest prose.” Honest prose indeed: an appeal to prejudice! And what about the enormous amount of futile and inept verse in traditional dress? And why “ fixed metrical base”? ?
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_27_0	One of the most remarkable developments of modern music has been the constant changing of time and idiom in the course of even a short piece ; at each change it is the listener’s obligation no less than the musician’s to be aware of the change. So in poetry, to limit poetry to a fxed metrical base is asking for trouble. The monstrous efiect of standardising the thythm of even so ancient a poem as The Holy Land of Walsinghame to a fixed metrical hase will readily be admitted.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_28_0	The claim of free verse is that actually each line, not only each stanza or passage, may be subject to a new musical change. Now if the reader does not recognise this change, it is his fault as much as it is the poet's; and if he does and still doesn’t like the rhythm, that again is as much his fault as the poet’s that their musical taste differs. Admitted, few poets who write free verse have any great sense of musical unity ; they cannot often relate the changes to any appreciable unity of structure. But this can be and has been done; and the failure to get more than an episodic interest in a poem is just as marked in poems written in stanzas or couplets as in free verse. Local rhythmic felicities in English poetry are, comparatively, far more numerous than poems whose general rhythmic structure commends itself without remarkable excitements.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_29_0	"The Whitmanic couplet that Mr Trevelyan holds out for scorn seems to me clear enough: the long second line expresses admirably the rhythm of a man, in fact, with a steady job and no worries about the future. An again, all “ honest prose” is capable of reduction to poetry by the simple expedient of letting it fall into short lines, each capable of a rhythm. Most sermons, for instance, can be readily reduced to blank verse. Conversely, all traditional verse can be written and read as prose; rhymes, “poetical"" inversions, and archaisms are the only ingredients that give it away at all easily. But the fact is, that in reading prose or in reading verse quite a different attitude is adopted by the reader, and it is this attitude more than the intrinsic quality of the writing that logically decides whether it is prose or poetry that is being read, Of this I shall shortly treat."
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_30_0	Meanwhile let us turn from Mr Trevelyan to Mr J. B. §, Haldane, our second prophet. In his remarkable essay on the Future of Science, Mr J. B. S. Haldane, while lavish of his quotations from poets living and dead, takes a gloomy view of the poetic scene. He holds that the decay of Poetry to-day is due to the defective education of the poets; the poet must understand his subject-matter, He affirms that at present not a single competent poet understands industrial life, that no poet since Shelley has been up to date in chemical knowledge, and that if we want poets to interpret physical science, which is, says Mr Haldane, vastly more stimulating to the imagination than the Classics, we must see that our possible poets are instructed in science and economics.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_31_0	“Not until our poets are once more drawn from the educated classes (I speak as a scientist) will they appeal to the average man by showing him that beauty in his own life, as Homer and Virgil appealed to the street urchins who scrawled their verses on the walls of Pompeii.”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_32_0	There is a wonderful amount of loose thinking in this — short paragraph ; the last sentence particularly is brimful of mischief and mis-statement. It reads as a challenge; but accepting it as a professional poet, I must allow Mr Haldane choice of weapons, which will of course be the scientific method. Then to isolate his facts or assumptions, test them critically in turn, tabulating them with (a), (b), and (c).
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_33_0	(a) Poetry is in decay because Poetry has lost touch with Science: and Science is the chief interest of the average Englishman to-day.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_34_0	"My comment is that decay pre-supposes a prime; but Poetry has never had a prime in which it has been in touch with the average man, except in societies where the poet has not yet specialised as a bard, and which are so homogeneous that all duties and pastimes are interchangeable ; not in advanced societies where, in a common calamity or triumph, the distinction of class, education, occupation, and so on temporarily disappear, and the consequent poetry has an appeal as wide as it is intense. Decay and prime then are purely local phenomena, occurring in different levels of society, which as high-brow, low-brow, . and mezzo-brow have no discoverable literary contact ; and even so they are not absolute terms, as one may talk of the prime and decay of roses, or of the human body. "" Shakespeare’s Tempest in one sense is the prime of English imaginative drama; but if the prime is to be put at Marlow’s Tamerlaine or Kidd’s Spanish Tragedy, the Tempest must be admitted to show signs of the decay of those elements which made the former plays admirable."
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_35_0	Moreover, Science itself is not the interest of the average Englishman any more than Poetry. There is a high-brow science class really interested in its developments, a mezzo-brow science class grateful for the comfort it provides, and a low-brow class more or less indifferent to it, except as its development affects wages and labour. And even within the limits of brow-classification, what does “average” mean? Until a cerebral index can be arranged to decide intelligence as readily as a cephalic index decides race, and until poems can be subjected to a critical analysis as readily as physical substances are to spectral analysis, we cannot scientifically assume that an average can in either case be struck.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_36_0	(b) There has been no poet up to date in chemistry since Shelley ; our competent poets are also uneducated in the science of economics, and unacquainted with industrial life.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_37_0	I don’t know in the least what ‘‘ competent ” means to Mr Haldane. Professional scientists, he says, have no perception of literary form ; and since he admits that he is now talking as a scientist, the only meaning that he can rightly attach to “competent” is “ well spoken of jn literary circles ”— and literary circles are notoriously fallible and fickle. Mr Haldane is sadly misinformed about the education of living poets. Among the most competent of these, according to the contemporary highbrow valuation, are to be found an architect, a mining engineer, an economic expert, a navvy, a scavenger, a senator, a natural historian, a museum official, a professional soldier, a clerk in the Standard Oil Company, a tramp, a dog-breeder, a peer, a seaman, and a metaphysician. This may be confirmed by the short biographies given in Mr Louis Unkermeyer’s Modern British Poets. For a poet who has been up to date in Science since Shelley, what about Francis Thompson? At one time it was his chief interest.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_38_0	(c) Really competent poets interpret life: therefore welleducated poets of the future will achieve great poetry chiefly by interpreting Science and Industry, which are the only forms of life at present not suffering from decay.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_39_0	When a scientist talks about interpretation then difficulties begin. The nearest he can get to interpretation is a simplification of technical language into something rudely resembling unlearned speech: “ Einstein made Easy.” ‘‘ Mendelism at a Glance.” These are interpretations, but they differ from poetic interpretation in respecting the original structure of thought, at any rate, in outline. The scientific method is consistently one of accurate equations and reasonable cross-references, e.g. “The sum of the squares on the smaller sides of a rightangled triangle is equal to the square on the hypotenuse side”; or “ water is formed of two parts hydrogen gas to one part of oxygen”; or the negroid races may be readily distinguished by black skin, broad lips, and curly black hair.” When therefore a scientist speaks of a poet “interpreting” industrial life he expects the interpretation to be as simple as Pythagoras’ interpretation of the two sides of the right-angled triangle in terms of the hypotenuse, or any other interpretative formula of the physicist or anthropologist. Now, while it may be maintained that legitimate cross references can be made between the images or rhythms of a poem, and the physical and imaginative context from which that poem merged, the scientist cannot expect even in traditional (let alone modern) poetry to find any equational formula constant between the poem and its context. The scientific mind gets a rude shock when it learns, for instance, that whereas the original Royal George actually did go down, as Thomas Campbell
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_39_1	relates, with Admiral Kempenfeldt and his twice four hundred men on board, the original “‘ schooner Hesperus ” was not really wrecked at all, but reached Boston harbour with a damaged bowsprit only; the female lashed to a mast, which Longfellow noted in his diary of the same storm, belonged to a vessel whose fate was never “interpreted.” Again, Longfellow’s phrase about the old moon having the young moon on her arm is salvage, so to speak, from yet another wreck altogether, that of Sir Patrick Spens’ ship on its return from “ Norraway over the faem.” And Sir Patrick Spens himself, if it comes to that, had historically speaking nothing whatever to do with either of the two voyages which, fused together as one, form the subject of “‘ Sir Patrick Spens,” the ballad.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_40_0	That Mr Haldane is unaware how well educated many of our “ competent poets” are is probably due to their refusal to interpret scientific or industrial experience in the way he intends; and the fact is, purely literary poets are those which appeal most to scientists, as Mr Haldane’s own quotations prove. I don’t imagine he would have much use for a modern Purple Island in physiology, a Loves of the Planis in botany, or a Polyolbion in geography ; and I haven’t noticed him rushing into print with 4 retraction of his statements on Mr Noyes’ account, whose recent accomplished epic, The Torch-bearers, purports to give a history of the triumphs of Science throughout the ages.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_41_0	But we are forgetting those urchins of Pompeii. Were they really so entranced with the Iliad that they could not contain themselves when they saw a blank wall? Surely a simpler explanation would be that they were airing their calligraphic accomplishments, and the first things that occurred to them to put down were lines of verse that had been beaten into them that day at school. On the nursery wall next door as I write is the inspiring reflection in chalk:
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_42_0	“Dame Trot was an old woman with kind blue eyes and a white . . .”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_43_0	for I have two urchins learning to read and write, and F their School Primer opens with this tale of Dame Trot. And does Mr Haldane remember the Greek epigram of the doctor who objected to his son learning Homer ? He complained that the boy came home with a rigmarole about one Achilles, who sent many valiant souls down to Hades. “What good does that stuff do him? Why, I myself, in the course of my profession, have done as much as Achilles.” That doctor anticipated (by two thousand years) Mr Haldane’s view that the Classics were played out, but he was powerless to prevent a number of competent poets who have come since, including Virgil — whose works also the urchins scrawled on the Pompeian walls, from sucking rich life from even the dry bones of Homer. What, however, is the state of English Poetry to-day ? I would suggest that among the low-brow public—readers of say Tit-Bits, H. M. Hull, A. S. M. Hutchinson, Edgar Rice Burrows, Gene Stratton Porter — poetry is in a poor way. John Oxenham has had a success, but minute in proportion with his potential public. The causes are not obscure. This is the public created by; elementary education ; elementary education has been a by-product of industrialism, and is aimed not at a humaner culture, but at raising the industrial and civic efficiency of the masses. Poetry as it has been taught in the elementary schools in years gone by has,
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_43_1	therefore, not encouraged many children on leaving school to continue their acquaintance with it; but novels and stories have formed no part of the curriculum, and can therefore be read without prejudice. The mezzo-brow public has had usually two or three years of schgoling more than the low-brow public, and reads more reputably ; it corresponds closely with the middle class, and is educated for the higher commercial groups of industrialism.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_44_0	Open any one of the better monthly magazines of fiction : each story, though it falls short of literature with a capital L, is thoroughly workmanlike. It has a definite point to which it moves easily and economically; the characters, unless the story is definitely a farce, are convincing; the local colour is carefully applied. In two cases out of three a considerable demand is made on the reader’s observation and memory for slight clues to the denouement occurring in the first page of the story; and even when the denouement comes, it comes quietly, perhaps in a single word, a mere gesture, by which the reader who has not cultivated the “ short-story sense ” will be completely baffled. But whereas the art of the short story has advanced enormously in the course of the last thirty years, and the intelligence of the short-story reader with it, the general run of verse that we find occasionally sandwiched between short stories in these magazines is as banal, nerveless, and amateur as could well be imagined.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_45_0	Now the difference is, there is a genuine and sincere demand for the short story on its own account. The question “is it literature ? ”’ does not arise. There is no such demand for verse. Its appearance at all in a shilling magazine is only a survival from the days before modern education and the short-story boom, when poetry was really read and enjoyed by the upper middle classes, the days when crowds queued up for a new canto of Don Juan, and a publisher could offer ‘Thomas Moore 3000 guineas advanced royalties for Lalla Rookh. 'The publishing of poetry in volume form is similarly a mere windowdressing, a graceful tribute to the past, a sop to literature ; but not a business proposition. ‘The mezzo-brow attitude towards the poet has since the boom days become a most unhealthy one; it is like that of modern youth towards its parents, a sentiment that has gradually changed, after a series of disappointments and misunderstandings, from affectionate respect to scorn and indifference.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_46_0	There is nothing wrong with poetry in itself, as there is nothing wrong with parenthood itself; both are inevitable forms of life. But the claim of a certain generation of parents to regulate the lives of their growing sons and daughters according to a traditional method cannot be met when that method is unsuited to the changed conditions of life. These sons and daughters will, however, soon marry and become parents themselves, however strongly they disapprove of parenthood; and poetry, like parenthood, is an instinct that cannot be long repressed.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_47_0	It is, again, largely because of an educational system which links poetry up with geometry and French as “subjects to be done” — and to be “ done ” in school is to be “done for” in private life — that poetry is viewed with as great suspicion by the intellectual middle classes as by their social inferiors. ‘The pulpit has assisted in deepening this suspicion. ‘The poet always, it is thought, has a sinister design on the reader. Either he is trying to put over a spiritual or historical message of some dry sort, or he is claiming genius and its anti-social privileges. In any case he is drawing the reader from the quiet paths of enjoyable reading to the stern mountain of literature, a region from which one customarily returns jaded, if improved, to impress other travellers with a satchel full of poetic specimens, chipped from the hard rocks and carefully ticketed. This mistrust of the poet ensures that, dead poets only being “done” in schools and universities, living poets cannot economically practise the art for a livelihood. Patronage is dead these two hundred years, and the high-brow public is not large enough to support its poets by casual purchase of their wares. ‘The result is that the writing of poetry is now largely in the hands of gifted young amateurs, who publish a single book, and then leave poetry for the more serious and remunerative work of prose; of idlers with money who want a literary reputation,
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_47_1	and find a series of lyrics less fatiguing to produce than a novel ; and of retired judges, ambassadors, and heads of colleges and such, who crown their career with a volume of graceful verse,—people, in fact, who encourage rather than dispel the lack of confidence in poetry ; so that it is next to impossible for a serious practising poet to get a hearing from the middleclass public, which is numerically large enough to support dozens of poets, and still less from the low-brow public, which could afford to make them all men of wealth.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_48_0	The public that is acquiring a short-story sense and a film sense and a fast-traftic sense and a radio-sense is not a dull public ; as it is not a dull public, neither is it a lazy public. The enthusiasm for the cross-word puzzle and for home-made radio sets proves that. The theory that because industrial, commercial, or professional life weighs so heavy, poetry, to make any appeal at all, must be a narcotic, can no longer stand. On the contrary, the daily round is so routine-ridden that, except where the standard of living is definitely below the poverty line, any stimulant to thought of an adventurous kind is most welcome, though indeed the adventure is bound by economic, ethical, religious, and educational limits. “The poetry sense has not been correspondingly cultivated with these other new senses largely because poetry, properly understood, makes demands at variance with the utilitarian system of education and life. As a marketable commodity poetry is in a vicious circle: the less it is wanted the duller it gets, and the duller it get the less it is wanted, A young workman cannot afford to apprentice himself to the poetry trade, which is suffering sadly from inefficiency and dilution. In the short-story trade wages are high. ‘Though the goods are machine-cut, he has the satisfaction of knowing that they meet a genuine demand. The models improve in speed and finish yearly.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_49_0	But it would be the greatest mistake to push this metaphor farther, to regard poetry as a sort of perpetual coach-building, and fiction as a sort of motor-car industry ; to say that a Coronation coach, lumbering and heavily gilded, or a smart barouche with armorial designs on the door, drawn through the park by a pair of spanking greys, though all very well in their way, cannot be compared for speed, comfort, or distinction witha 1925 Rolls Royce. True, language and conditions of life have changed so completely in the last fifty years that the greater part of traditional English poetry is utterly out of date except to scholars ; what was once the pride of the roads we now think of asalumbering coach. But this is my contention : there is no reason why modern verse should not become to modern prose what the airplane is to the motor-car. Properly handled, poetry has certain mechanical adyantages over prose: prose can never rise off the ground ; it must keep to the roads or the open country. ‘The lowbrow, mezzo-brow, and the backward part even of the high-brow public does not realise this, and will demand an explanation of mechanical theory, if not a demonstration of practice.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_50_0	Simply put, the intrinsic virtues of poetry are these: its rhythms, rhymes, and texture have an actual toxic effect on the central nervous system. In the resulting condition the imaginative powers are quickened and strengthened, voices are heard, images are called up, and various emotions felt of a far greater intensity than in waking life. This toxic effect is of greater or less strength according to the level of mental functioning required, which varies between the more or less sedate thought of day-dreaming and the monstrosities of trance or a deep sleep. The soup tablet firm that puts its advertisement into a rough rhyme—
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_51_0	“Why does the Huntsman devour the fox so? Because there is nothing for dinner but Broxo,”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_52_0	and the student who masters his lists of facts by help of a rhymed memoria technica — In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue” — are alike aware of this physiological effect verse has on mental receptivity. But besides the greater vividness of image and strengthening of music, the heightening of receptivity and sensitivity that verse properly handled brings, there is another great contribution: that is the awaredness of a whole region of hidden association and implication behind phrases that in prose would be accepted at their face value. For instance, the adjective “ pettifogging ” would in rose be construed merely as the conventional insult for a lawyer. If the same adjective were to be used in poetry qualifying, say, a philosopher, there would be an increased vitality in the word, which thereupon, for those aware of its etymology, would recall its connection with Fugger, the great continental merchant banker whose minions, the little fuggers, were so sly at their trade. The philosopher would thus be accused of having a commercial mind, and the same attachment to verbal formula did ancient authority as a lawyer. At the same time the “ fog ” syllable would take on a life of its own; “ pettiness” and “‘ fogginess,”’ though conceptions not originally bound up with “ pettifogging,” would colour the fade in which they occurred, and mate with the hidden associations of the other words there contained. One of the chief powers of poetry is in the poet’s ability to
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_52_1	control these hidden or forgotten associations of words while remaining in the toxic condition of which I have spoken, so that they interact in a sense distinct from the face value of the poem, a sense which cannot be understood except by those in the same condition of heightened sensibility. Poetry is able to use both the method of logic and the method of fantastic thought, which is sensorial hieroglyphic ; and what cannot be expressed by either of these means can be conveyed in the musical side of poetry, the rhythm, rhyme, and texture, which have not of course fulfilled their function merely by inducing and maintaining the toxic condition.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_53_0	This briefly is the theory of Poetry as I understand it ; but whether, and if so how soon, the poetry-sense will appear in a wide circle of readers is another question. I cannot foresee any immediate social or political change that will produce it. A great deal of poetry that has been popularly admired in times past has been admired for reasons unconcerned with the peculiar powers of poetry as I have just outlined them ; it has been admired merely for the elegance of the stories it told, or the morality of its sentiments, or the divine character it professed ; and it is doubtful, whether in Europe at least, there has ever been widely spread a poetry-sense which, once the added receptivity induced by verse has been taken into account, has been distinguishable from a prose-sense. Perhaps some discovery by which food and other necessities of life could everywhere be obtained locally, together with a solution of the population question, might give the necessary background to a national revitalising of Poetry ; for England must first be freed from the economic obsession which colours all human relations and qualities to-day. The difficulties of keeping supplies of food, clothing, and so on in circulation by the authority are now largely smoothed over by standardisation of goods, and by standardisation of the consumers’ minds by education and the press. If supplies became more plentiful, and decentralisation of industry and therefore of standardised mentality became possible, poetry of a greater

For the standardisation of mind has achieved the practical result that theit immediate and formal characteristics of any matter under examination, usually recognised in terms of value or efficiency, are alone discerned; other latent characteristics, spiritual or personal, are generally suppressed as contributing nothing to the mechanical purpose of life.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_54_0	Meanwhile there is a small part of society which, being more or less independent of economic fashions, is at liberty to think for itself, and to have adventures in Poetry and Art beyond the bounds which enclose the middle class. This is not to say that the advanced poet is necessarily a man of wealth — wealth often brings with it mental languor — or even that he is always born into the independent classes; but certainly any support he gets will be from men of independent means, and if he wishes to consolidate any success that naiveté has won for him, he must learn to speak the language of that class, and become as free from social prejudice as any of its members ; he must become aware of the history of the art he practises, and in the light of this history must discover what is strong in his own work and remain unabashed by the riches of his new experience. ‘This advanced art is a very small part of the whole artistic output, and if the greatest immediate good of the greatest number is to be sidered cannot be justified. Its practicians are not I have said, paid a living wage, and direct patronage is dead ; that they manage to live at all and find time for their work is usually due to a certain amount of indirect patronage in the form of presents or of congenial appointments controlled by their admirers, enabling them to keep
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_54_1	in touch with this independent society, But this art, freed from any retrograde temptations by the broken market for poetry in the backward part of society, is alone worth serious discussion, and has indeed begun to make as great a revolution in English poetry as, for instance, the one that came shortly after the Norman Conquest, when the love-song and the warm breath of classical literature from the South enriched an art that hitherto had been devoted almost entirely to war, terror, religion, and laments for the good old days.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_55_0	Poetry has, in a word, begun to “ go round the corner.” The straight street in which English bards have for centuries walked is no longer so attractive, now that a concealed turning has been found opening up a new street or network of streets whose existence tradition hardly suspected. ‘Traditionalists will even say of the adventurers: “they have completely disappeared ; they are walking in the suburbs of poetry called alternatively Nonsense or Madness.” But: it disturbs these traditionalists that the defections from the highway are numerous, and that the poets concerned cannot be accused of ignorance of the old ways, of mental unbalance in other departments of life, or of insincerity. As a well-dyed traditionalist once myself, I can recall my anger and impatience when reading advanced verse, which seemed to me utterly unlovely and meaningless; anger and impatience still occasionally arise in me when I read, but for a different reason: I dislike poetry which, while discarding the old usages, does not make effective use of the new methods at its disposal, and I would be the last to deny that in the present transitional and experimental stage there are writers who have attempted to get notoriety by innovations and obscurities in which they do not themselves believe; but I do not believe that they are very numerous.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_56_0	This new departure can best be illustrated by an analogy from painting, because painting began the round-the-corner movement before poetry. The traditional view of portrait-painting in England has been that the likeness must be as nearly as possible photographic, and the colours similarly must imitate the natural colours of the body; the pose and dress and background are also expected to be informative of the conditions and circumstances of the character depicted. But portrait-painting, owing largely to the competition of the camera, has taken a new turn; a modern portrait represents hardly anything of what we may call the formal history and geography of the sitter. ‘The rest is a new experience based on the relationship between painter and sitter. Whatever traits of character or circumstance in the sitter have impressed themselves most strongly on the painter form the nucleus of the design — sensorial hieroglyph again — and the design is harmonious with an untranslatable but none the less effective statement in terms of colour, texture, and form. Statement of what? Ofa unique experience to which the painter and sitter equally contribute. Traditional painting assumes that a speaking likeness of the thing painted, the likeness that a smooth pool of water or a good mirror would give, provided that the thing painted is a reputable object and properly posed, is the final goal of art. Traditional poetry similarly is, in intention at least, concerned with the translation into smooth verse, direct or allegorical, of selected and not always historical
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_56_1	episodes in history, of selected slices of geography, and of idealised moods and characters.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_57_0	Modern poetry and modern painting do not set ou translate or interpret in the traditional sense, loan v provide an independent experience, to which indeed formal history and geography are pre-requisites, and from which they may even be psychologically deduceg but in which they are not important interests in them. selves. In giving this new experience it is found necegsq; to dispense with a great deal of grammatic, logical, and photographic convention; with prejudices about the absolute and permanent value of particular kinds of truth, beauty, virtue, and harmony ; and with the restriction order under which caprice, error, and unsolved conflict have hitherto been debarred from giving poetry the same reality as life.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_58_0	I can overhear the comment: “ better that poetry should perish utterly than lose its idealistic character.” So recently a pretty quarrel has been picked over an unidealistic though not particularly outrageous public monument in Hyde Park. It is fitting that obscene mutilations should have been committed on it by a party of law students who would stand politically for tradition and photographically idealistic accuracy. It is possible that this particular panel is definitely anti-traditional in conception and invites positive reprisals; but there is this about much unidealistic modern art, that, though untraditional in its technique, character, and end, so it is most untraditional in not claiming superiority for itself over all existing forms. “The new methods are not claimed as absolutely better, as all new schools hitherto have been ; they are only claimed as different, and as more suited to the moods of the party that professes them. ‘Tvraditionalism and the new method (which, being a cousin of mathematic Relativity, may therefore borrow the name) do not deny each other any more than post-Euclidian geometry denies the local truth and coherence of Euclidian geometry. Advanced and traditional poetry can live side by side, and the same poet can employ both methods alternatively without self-contradiction.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_59_0	I may conclude with a few particular statements about this new poetic Relativity. In subject — but to speak of the subject is to speak in terms of translation — so let us say in atmosphere and experience, it has no obvious bounds other than those to which the human mind is always subject. Laura Riding Gottschalk has put the claim clearly enough :
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_60_0	“The elder poets of England and America are still worshipping that old god Experience: ‘It is all there somewhere in life, the truth, and you must only let life flow over you, inundate you, and it will leave behind with you the fine sediment of proper feeling. You are clay, life is a potter, it is very wonderful. You are like this, like that, you are swept here and there, you are dead.’ But who has ever learned anything from experience ? Development comes through self-exercise, not through being hammered upon. The function of the new poetic mind is inductive rather than deductive. Life needs proving in Poetry, as well as in Science. The poet, the human impulse, is the only premise. He is the potter. He is the maker of beauty, since all form originates in him, and of meaning, since he names the content. Confronted by a terrifying, absorbing, fascinating universe, he does not cry out, ‘ How big, how terrifying, how fascinating!’ and permits himself to be overcome by it, but answers it, since this universe, a thing apart, can be answered in no other way, atom for atom, in a recreated universe of his own, a universe defiantly intelligible.”
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_61_0	In grammar this new poetic Relativity adopts the syntactical convention of the thought-level on which it is staged. ‘This may be regular enough, but if the mood reaches a point in fantasia where grammar becomes frayed and snaps, then it can dispense with grammar. In structure it is Protean ; there is no architectural preconception; the growth is organic. In imagery it j, only bound by the preference of the individual autho; for imagery of a particular kind, as that of touch, sound, motion, colour, shape or measurement, and by the conjectural intuition of the reader for remote allusions, One of the most remarkable traits of recent verse has been the qualification of the experience of one sense by that of another. So Miss Sitwell speaks of “ clucking flowers,” meaning flowers bent down so that they seem like hens clucking ; and of “ early light creaking down,” meaning light moving uncertainly in the early morning, out in angles and squares as it streams across a house, getting such a wooden quality that in its slow movement it may be almost said to creak; “shrill grass,” meaning grass so young and green that you would credit it with the piping voice of a fledgling or a child. In diction the mood determines the vocabulary: literary, exotic, archaic, commercial, homely, learned, or disgusting: and, as in Mr Eliot’s The Waste Land, each of these vocabularies contributes in turn. In rhyme, rhythm, and texture it is evolving a music as complex
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_61_1	and free as instrumental music. In implication, it draws freely on modern psychological research for the exploitation of the hidden symbolism and associations of words employed. In literary allusion it assumes an intimacy with the betterknown imaginative writers in all languages. It makes severe demands upon the reader; but the theory that the poet should do all the work and spoon-feed his reader is perhaps one of the greatest weaknesses of traditional verse.
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_62_0	It is at present coloured by the mood of sceptic irony in which the society which approves these new methods lives: irony is the state which succeeds revolt and despair, as revolt and despair succeed complacency and certainty. But irony is not at all a final mood, it is more negative than positive in character, and must yield eventually to a richer and more constructive life. Poetry is moving into this new life more slowly than the graphic arts or music, because it is the art embracing all arts; in the same way Philosophy is the science of sciences; and until mathematics, theology, biology, and psychology have made and consolidated their separate advances, cannot take up its position in support. Perhaps the reason why advanced poetry is often so confusing to the student to-day is that in few cases have the musical, the pictorial, and the intellectual forces kept proper alignment in the general advance. And as a great many so-called philosophic systems are not strictly philosophy at all, but generalisations from psychological, theological, and mathematical or economic theory, so poetry self-styled that specialises in thought, in music, or in imagery, but in each case to the neglect of the other departments, is not strictly poetry. The actual technique and direction of poetry may suffer the most astounding changes, but to keep its name and continuity it must always remain a unique art, harmonising its contributory arts, and raising no organ of sense or thought to the magistracy of its
1-18-another-future-poetry	doc_26_62_1	fellows.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_0_0	COCK ROBIN'S DECEASE
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_1_0	APOLOGY
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_2_0	"IF I believed that the general drift of this essay represented my own opinion only, I should not publish it. For I am one who some years back passed out of the ranks of what Mr Robert Graves once called ""practising poets,"" and I might therefore be considered disqualified to speak. But in editing the ""Six-penny Poets"" I learnt what I believe is still unknown to the general public, how impossible the writing or publishing of poetry has become, except by the wealthy. I thought my errand, to demand the gift of valuable copyrights, reasonably impudent; but I found my- self, again and again, regarded with pity and amazement, as one doubtfully quite stalwart in his wits""; and in one case, where I asked with hesitation for a poet well known and in his prose certainly almost a ""best-seller,"" his publisher metaphorically threw his whole list at me. ""You can take any poet you like."""
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_3_0	THE FACT OF THE MURDER ESTABLISHED
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_4_0	"It is commonly believed that the present is a time when a taste for poetry is widely diffused. This is ascribed sometimes to the War, which ""brought us face to face with reality"" and spiritualised this generation. As is well known, books of verse had a vogue a dozen years ago; indeed, looking back, one remembers slim pamphlets of an incredibly exiguous prettiness that gave their authors both reputation and sales that now - the sales, at any rate - would not be attained by a book of Robert Bridges or Walter de la Mare. I have often seen the assertion that this wide diffusion of poetic taste and of hunger for poetry has been shown by the circulation of Messrs Benn's Sixpenny Poets; that series, so reviewers were in the habit of saying, proved that there is a public for good poetry ""at a reasonable price."" Which gives me the chance to clear myself from an imputation that has sometimes lain heavily on my conscience. For I, who edited that series, was never a Sixpennyite(""I was never a Wilkesite,"" said Wilkes to George III). I do not, and never did, consider sixpence ""a reasonable price"" for poetry. But I did, in the insight that comes from years of patient study of one's fellow-men and -women, perceive that sixpence was the valuation that the average reader set upon it."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_5_0	In all grave seriousness though, there were good reasons justifying the six-pennyising of contemporary poetry; and the series did to some extent get round-a monstrous detour-the reviewers and anthologists, and make some fine living poets known to a public which could not afford to buy their separate books. When I escaped from the series I had seen enough to be surer than ever that if we could have a greater honesty-competence it is not reasonable to ask-in the reviewing of poetry, and some wider channel of approach to the public that is too diffident to claim an interest in poetry, poetry could have a chance again.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_6_0	Every publisher knows that poetry was never in a worse slough of neglect than at present. In proof of this, let two facts stare us in the face. First, there is at the present moment no publisher who would at his own expense publish a new poet. (If there is, let him speak, that we may all look at a brave man.) I can see, looking round the now fairly familiar ranks of the Barabbadae, one partial exception to my statement, but, since he is publishing this essay, I cannot say what I think of the poetry he publishes. (My opinion would be quite respectful, but, in brief, I think his activities here valuable chiefly as a part of his effort towards freedom and freshness of thinking.)
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_7_0	"The reader will object that verse continues to be published. Yes; at the author's expense, or verse by established writers. No doubt Edward Shanks and W. J. Turner and John Freeman find publishers; but hardly even verse by these would stir a publisher to any enthusiasm as a commercial man. Or a writer who has a reasonably good name for his prose might find a publisher willing to sanction the aberration of rhyme, especially if he were given ""an option"" on a novel afterwards. But if William Shakespeare were to come forward now with Venus and Adonis or John Keats with Sleep and Poetry (excellent collocation!)-the illustrations are unsatisfactory, for first books of verse often deserve to be turned down on their merits; if I were a publisher I should turn down Venus and Adonis simply because the world is so cluttered up with better stuff-neither of these eminent authors would find a publisher. But both, of course, found one in their own day, and both made some money by these very immature and imperfect books."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_8_0	My second fact is this: no new poetic reputation has been made for some years. The last reputation with real solid bottom to it was Edmund Blunden's, made nearly eight years ago. Humbert Wolfe? Mr Wolfe published verse long ago and the beginnings of some fame were already there; also, his reputation has come so dazzlingly and tempestuously that opinion has not yet settled about it. And, if I pass Mr Wolfe as an exception to my belief that no new reputation belongs to the last four years, there are also one or two partial exceptions-Roy Campbell, for example. But The Flaming Terrapin is now quite an old affair.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_9_0	"I am not going on with partial exceptions. The reader can test my statement for himself, and he will find it startlingly true. Nor can we take comfort from the reflection that this is a normal state of things. Thirty-five, thirty, twenty-five years ago, in the Dark Ages before the War had revealed to us our love of poetry-when there were no sixpennies, and poetry was rarely published ""at a reasonable price""-there was seldom the passage of a year without some new reputation-a reputation that represented some real believers and was not all an unconvincing noise made by half a dozen pairs of clapping hands."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_10_0	THE ACCUSED
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_11_0	PUBLISHERS AND POETS
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_12_0	"It is matter of notorious truth that publishers are grossly commercial in outlook, and blind to all excellence except of the marketable sort. No one will expect me, an author, to stand up for them. And yet as an author by whom publishers have often lost money but rarely made it-I have a kindness for them. Every publisher seems to have a side on which he is vulnerable, however clad in mail of shrewdness else. There is one London publisher who finds himself almost physically unable to reject a MS. in which he sees the name of Pan or such words as dryad and naiad, so great is the glamour that the world of Hellas threw over his unclass ically educated youth. Another cannot resist any book that is vigorously ""agin the Government"" (and in the Government I include God and Religion and the Primrose League, and literature that is aware of Tennyson, Browning, Thackeray, or anyone who died before 1910, except Blake and Samuel Butler). You can place almost any competently written prose MS., if you know where to send it (which agents do not). Publishers constantly take at their own cost books that they know have only an out- side chance of paying expenses-take them because they like them and think they ought to be liked by others. This is one reason why they go bankrupt ""at the rate of one a week."" It was the public and the press that gave up poetry first, not the publishers;"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_12_1	"publishers continued accepting and issuing verse as long as they possibly could, and a great deal longer than they should have done had they been commercially wise. Any panel of living poets, inquiring into this question of ""Who killed Cock Robin?"" would dismiss first of the accused the publishers-with some admonition for errors of judgment, but with no serious stain on their character."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_13_0	And, after all, if the poets do not know about this matter, who does?
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_14_0	"Yet-and this is the fact that the supporters of the ""poetry at a reasonable price will sell"" theory were muddily groping in their minds for-publishers and poets (a second batch of the accused now make their appearance in our court) are blamed for the books that contained a sixteen-line poem poem spilt over two pages and a four-line epigram occupying a whole page solely to itself—a tiny handful of verse priced at six shillings or even more. Certainly there have been such books, some of them scandalously thin value for the money asked; and they have helped to build up in booksellers and in those unhappy men, publishers' travellers, a distaste that has reinforced the public's. The public reasonably wants something for its money. Why accumulate slim volumes when sooner or later there will be a collected edition? ""Thank God, we can now have a complete edition!"" as the enthusiastic ""poetry-lover"" said when he heard that Matthew Arnold was dead. And you need not wait for a poet's death. If you will wait until he is forty, you will get your collected edition; he won't write many short poems after that, the vast bulk of the world's good lyrical poetry has been written by men under thirty. If these meagre, mean little volumes are aimed at ""the collector,"" they are aimed at a bird who daily waxes scarcer and warier -he has been ""had"" by so many suddenly inflated reputations in the last eight years, that have gone to little"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_14_1	"in six months. Better stick to de la Mare and Housman and Kipling, and not risk money on Blunden and Drinkwater and the Sitwells. It is noteworthy that the private presses that used to issue, as recently as five years back, limited editions at a guinea or so of poets newly famous, seem to have gone out of business. This is another proof, where proof abounds, that poetry has become unmarketable, even when ""signed and numbered,"" with all sorts of filigree thrown in. Nor would any true poet care to be known only to the collectors."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_15_0	"The public undeniably wants bulk for its money. It is even grumbling at novels that, instead of the proper hundred thousand words for 7s. 6d., give only seventy thousand or less. This discontent inevitably reacts on the publisher; it was a publisher who expressed to me his grief at the conduct of a fellow-publisher. ""He has the cheek to make up and sell as 7s. 6d. novels stories that have only sixty thousand words in them."" And when I displayed to another publisher my surprise at the big sale of Robert Graves' Lawrence and the Arabs-not from any disregard for its author, but merely because I had thought that we had all had enough of Lawrence for the time being the publisher slewed his chair round in amazement at my dullness. ""Why, look at the size of the book, man! Just look at what they get for 7s. 6d.! It's astonishing value for the money!"" And it is not merely the exciting quality of his material that has sold seventy thousand of Mr Masefield's Collected Poems; for sheer bulk, the book is a most satisfying bargain."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_16_0	"This excuse for the neglect of poetry has been overworked. The last generation bought slim volumes of poetry- Davidson's Fleet Street Eclogues (two series) and other books by him that were no larger, books also by William Watson, Stephen Phillips, Norman Gale. If I am not mistaken, Laurence Binyon sold more largely thirty years ago than he does to-day. No; people (a third accused, the public, makes a premature appearance) do not like poetry. If you emphasise the slim volumes, I must ask notice for such books also as Siegfried Sassoon's two 3s. 6d. ones; you get plenty there for a small enough sum. When, in pursuance of my practice of getting all I could, I had screwed out of Sassoon the last line that could be packed into an ""Augustan"" format, he wrote at the bottom of the list, ""Damn good sixpennyworth,"" to which his publisher added a caustic agreement. But the two 3s. 6d. books are equally good value for seven sixpences; and they are not the only books by living poets of which this is true. The public is not going to get off on the ""slim expensive volume"" plea."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_17_0	"In any case, you will never have poetry that is decent dished out in the novel's lavish style. (And even the novelist, if he has any self-respect, finds it hard to give as freely as custom and the circulating libraries demand.) That is why a poet who has to write novels is a slinking and cowardly person, ashamed of his garrulity; and a poet who has never so degraded himself feels horror when he hears that a man whom he knows has written for print-eighty, ninety, even a hundred thousand words. ""Do you mean to say,"" said my neighbour, the Poet Laureate, looking up from an advertisement in the Times Literary Supplement, ""that you have gone on, day after day, writing down words, until you have made a big book-a novel!"" The poets, then, can be acquitted for the present, with the publishers. But they will not altogether escape the Court. Some of them will appear before us again—both in their proper quality and as reviewers. This is merely a remand."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_18_0	THE PUBLIC
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_19_0	"We may as well admit that poetry cannot expect, nor do poets as a rule worry at not getting, the sales of novels and the more exciting kind of memoirs. As a matter of fact, the sales of even supposedly successful novels are often ridiculously smaller than is thought. Not only has Cock Robin been killed- Jack Sparrow, his drab-coated brother prose, can hardly keep alive. You could gather together in one room a company of novelists whose names are famous, or almost famous, and whose work is respected by people whose respect they are glad to have, such writers as-but I had better keep to generalities; and, having gathered them, if you said,""Hands up those who sell three thousand copies in the British Isles,"" the two or three who responded would feel embarrassingly conspicuous. I do not know how long the people I have in mind take to write a novel, but I think that an average of nine months is probable, though some at a really tremendous strain have to take less time. The financial return must be considered a wretched one. The successful business man will settle a ten thousand pounds deal without any noise; but for a book to bring in a hundred pounds of royalties the author has to be boomed till his name is known from Land's End to John o' Groats (or at any rate, Aberdeen). The circulating-library habit has done good to some who otherwise would not find a publisher at all;"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_19_1	but it has made it necessary for others to do a great deal more pot- boiling and to write even their most serious books more hurriedly than is good for them.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_20_0	"Verse, of course, is in a far more wretched case. If a book of verse got ""a decent show"" in the press and came out of it well enough to convince careful readers that it was not all a ramp-for the public has got terribly afraid of having some dreadful ""pup"" sold to it, after some of the books of verse that have been recommended to it-we ought to have enough comfortably-off ""poetry-lovers"" to buy 5000 copies of it. But the sales of well-known poets are grotesquely low. Humbert Wolfe's Requiem sold 7000; that figure is a portent. It is a success as outstanding as the 100,000 sales of The Constant Nymph or If Winter Comes. Robert Graves' Mockbeggar Hall, one of his best books, sold 289 copies; it may have sold another half-dozen after he told me this. Edith Sitwell, at a time when everyone knew her name, could not sell more than 300. She does better now. But if the publishers made known what they have sold the last five years of poets as well established as a dozen who will come to the reader's memory, and we threw together all the sales, excluding ""sheets"" and ""colonials,"" and divided by the number of poets and books, the resultant figure would be nearer 200 than 500."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_21_0	"Things are bad in the book business, and are going to get worse; for there have come upon us very rapidly two institutions that in conjunction are going to prove not less revolutionary of mankind's mental habits and outlook than the printing press, the discovery of America, or the industrialisation of the West by machinery have proved. These institutions are the cinema and broadcasting by wireless. Now that we have information on all subjects provided by the B.B.C., there is going to be an end of the cheap libraries that have in the past given us so much taut and often excellently scholarly information. Demos intends to get his ""home university,"" with the minimum of effort and expenditure, over a pipe at his fireside. Books will more than ever be a backwater of life, frequented only by those with a considerable sur- plus both of leisure and money. Such a reading class will scorn cheap handbooks, and in any case will not be numerous enough to make such enterprises pay their way. But it will be numerous enough to keep up a flickering existence for books more highly priced that minister directly to amusement. And, if America continues to buy books, then British authors with self-respect will still be able, as they are now, to write, if they are lucky enough to appeal to transatlantic taste."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_22_0	But we need not step into the shadow before time compels us to. We may note that neither the B.B.C. nor the movies will make things much worse for poetry than they are at present.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_23_0	EDITORS AND THEIR REVIEWERS
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_24_0	We are now on the track of the chief murderers. Let us first take the extenuating circumstances of the editor's case.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_25_0	"Last year, I read somewhere, a mile of new books was added to the British Museum library. Sir Ernest Benn says that 12,000 books on an average are published each year in these islands. Mr Hugh Walpole, with a generosity not always found in those whose reputation is established, has said recently¹ that it is harder than ever, harder than in his own struggling days, for an author to gain recognition; he added, ""and the press could not and did not review the mass of novels with anything like adequacy."" He might have pointed out that editors lighten their task by not reviewing poetry at all. However, editors have this excuse, that there is a flood of books with which they could not cope, even if they wished."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_26_0	"The author's case is hard, and harder than is inevitable. There is far less space given to reviewing than before the War. Twenty years ago-many less years ago there were several important journals that existed mainly for literature that have gone. I think of the Athenaeum, the Academy, the Literary World, the Saturday Westminster Gazette. The daily papers also reviewed books pretty regularly, as a matter of habit; such a weekly as Land and Water had space to notice books. Now, except when a book comes along that is considered ""news"" or whose author is of outstanding eminence, the reviewing of our daily press, with hardly an exception, is negligible. Publishers and authors would agree that review copies sent to the daily press are usually a wasted postage. We still have our weeklies; but I have the impression that even in these politics have encroached largely on the space once given to books. And poetry has gone to the wall first. The vast majority of copies of books of verse sent to editors are never reviewed at all. Publishers know, and poets know, that there is no hearing for verse; that it happens, not occasion- ally but constantly, that sixty copies are sent out, and less than ten notices are printed. And such notices! (but I shall come to that presently)."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_27_0	The reader may think I am referring to the neglect of those still numerous little books for whose publication the author has paid, and whose quality (in many, but by no means all instances) would justify an even heavier fine than he or she has self-imposed. I am not. A writer who would get fifty reviews, many of them careful ones, of a book of prose, will often get far less than a dozen notices, mostly mere mentions, of a book of verse. It is hard to believe that, after showing brains and imaginative power in his prose, he has become a fool because he writes in verse. Similar neglect is often meted out to books by writers whose main, or even sole, effort has been made in verse, with admitted success. I do not see how publishers can be expected to take the risk of issuing verse if it is not going to be reviewed. One leading publisher told me this year that he had now given up the practice of sending out verse for review; on the rare occasions when he published it, he sent out about six copies to editorial offices, and about a dozen to authors of reputation who were known to care for poetry, in the hope that they would send him back some word enthusiastic enough to be used in advertisement or might even write a review themselves.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_28_0	"When verse is reviewed, it is done in batches; the victims are gathered in a tumbril. I once had as a neighbour a well-known poet who was also a regular reviewer, and I used to watch him at his fell work. Nine poets to be all settled in six hundred words! He was not unkindly; but the odds were that one of the nine would be a writer whom he considered ""important"" (a favourite word of his). The other eight books, seeing this monster advance to take first bite at the six-hundred-words ration, must have known that their own commons would be short."

If at this moment editors had their offices raided, poetry of the past three years would be found stacked high in some—and the nearest second hand bookseller would furnish damning evidence against the others, in shelves crammed with books whose pages had not been cut.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_31_0	Moreover, there is little chance of periodical publication for the poet to- day. Time was, not so long since, when every good weekly had its regular poem. Now weeks pass poemless with Nation, New Statesman, and the rest. Some of these papers certainly do not publish twenty poems a year, where they used to publish at least fifty-two.

2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_33_0	"The novelist-if he gets noticed at all -will get reviews that will make him feel very humble, because of their generosity. Specialist books, those that demand a close study of the subject before a man can review them at all, are commonly reviewed with a patience, thoroughness, knowledge, and fairness that are entirely admirable. Two classes of books are abominably reviewed, books of verse and books on India; the reason is the same in each case, distaste. No subject bores us more than India, and nearly all of us dislike poetry; and a larger proportion of the few who do like poetry are outside the professional literary class than inside it. Poetry is not only skimpily treated, but when reviewed at all is reviewed far worse than any other class of literature. The impression obtains that no experience or ability is needed here, but merely a certain sappy exuberance and complacency. Most reviews are flaccid and meaningless, and the writers ought to be caned for the tags and thin-worn phrases that they use ""No lover of poetry can afford to miss this book."" And the enthusiastic reviews are in such towering vein that they have been a considerable factor in the process by which our language has been losing pith and edge. In the brief notices at the end of the Times Literary Supplement- which are meant to be, and are understood as, dismissal-you will often find praise which, if words meant anything, would be good enough for Milton or"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_33_1	Sophocles. When we want to be under- stood as commending really good work we have to be absurd.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_34_0	"Very few have any genuine opinion of their own where poetry is concerned. We are all bound to have no opinions in a vast number of matters, or only opinions lightly and tentatively held. But somewhere, surely, we should have opinions for which we would show fight, and which we would not relinquish except for good reason shown. But in poetry few, even of those who review it, hold opinions of any conviction. I suppose this is true all through of current literature, which is why within three months of a great writer's death there is always such a slump in his reputation; for some years we had been repeating things we did not honestly believe. But this ""turn-over"" of reputation is most pronounced by far with a poet's fame-for people care about prose, they form genuine opinions here and will put up their fists in defence."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_35_0	Thirty years ago Stephen Phillips was being reviewed with praise almost more than any poet has ever deserved; he was being reviewed as Mr Humbert Wolfe was last year. I juxtapose Phillips and Mr Wolfe merely as the best-reviewed poets of their time; and note further that against Mr Wolfe's spectacular seven thousand, Phillips's Herod and Paolo and Francesca sold their twenty thousands, Marpessa its ten thousands, his Poems more than Marpessa. Herod, according to Mr Max Beerbohm, was
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_36_0	so fiery coloured, so intense, the character so largely projected, the action so relentlessly progresses till the final drops of awe are wrung from us, that only the greatest of dramatic poets could accompany with verse quite worthy of it.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_37_0	Paolo and Francesca, according to William Archer, was
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_38_0	A thing of exquisite poetic form, yet tingling from first to last with intense dramatic life. Mr Phillips has achieved the impossible. Sardou could not have ordered the action more skilfully, Tennyson could not have clothed the passion in words of purer loveliness;
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_39_0	according to Sir Owen Seaman, Mr Phillips had
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_40_0	written a great dramatic poem which happens also to be a great poetic drama. We are justified in speaking of Mr Phillips's achievement as something without parallel in our age;
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_41_0	according to Churton Collins, the play
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_42_0	unquestionably places Mr Phillips in the first rank of modern dramatists and of modern poetry. It does more, it claims his kinship with the aristocrats of his art: with Sophocles and with Dante; according to Mr Richard le Gallienne, Poetry like this has not been written in England for many a long day, and it is Mr Phillips's double success that it is essentially and through and through dramatic poetry; for, while Paolo and Francesca is a noble poem, it is so, largely, for the reason that it is noble drama as well. It would be im- possible to exaggerate one's gratitude to Mr Phillips for this priceless gift of new beauty.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_43_0	It is natural for contemporaries to overrate a poet who appeals to them; but my complaint is not that Phillips was overrated, but that his stupendous place was so swiftly and completely levelled with the ground. It is many years now since anyone has dared to suggest that he was even a meritorious poet at all (though he was one), or any- thing but a rhetorician. Yet some of those who so extolled him are still great nabobs in our literature, and have a share in shaping current judgment. If I had said half the things that they said, I would be prepared to fight for my opinion thirty years later, unless I had entirely changed it.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_44_0	"Praise almost as ecstatic was occasionally given to John Davidson, who still has the smouldering ashes of a reputation, thanks to the two poems that the anthologies copy. But his fame, like that of Phillips, went so entirely that of neither of these poets-so eminent to their own generation-has there been any collected edition, or even an attempt at a selection. Davidson's work is full of flaws; you can see what necessity did, driving him on to one tour de force after another, always saying to himself, ""Let me but have a really decent return for this book, and then I will write what I want to write."" It is what poets-and artistic minds using prose- will increasingly be tempted to say to themselves. ""Oh, let me but once-I must have the ability somewhere, if I could but fling and torture the whole of myself into a mould so alien from me do a book that will succeed like If Winter Comes or, at any rate, Dusty Answer. Then I can write at leisure, sure of a remnant who will stay faithful to me, and numerous enough for me to pay my way."" But this never happens; for the price of pot-boiling is that for the rest of this incarnation you shall continue chopping and fetching wood. So, then, Davidson's work is full of hurry and strain, and he works with fables and themes hastily devised and thrown up into a flimsy trellis. But how crammed with magnificence it is!"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_44_1	No other English verse is shot and variegated with such gorgeous colouring.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_45_0	I have taken the reviewing of the generation immediately before my own, because there is a common opinion that taste and judgment in poetry have been steadily improving since the admittedly bad days when Wordsworth and Shelley were turned down by the press. It is believed, especially, that we who live to-day are better in this respect than even the last generation. We are not better, we are worse where poetry is concerned, as could be proved by the poetry-reviewing of a century ago. When we are smug at the expense of the one age that has been singled out as scandalously stupid, it is out of ignorance both of the poets who were criticised and of the reviews that are condemned. Keats, we all know, was criticised sharply; but he was not criticised more unjustly than many another poet. If he had lived another three years he would have been accepted; and Endymion, which some of the critics mauled, is full of faults and its tags are abominable, as the Quarterly rightly pointed out. The Quarterly's tone was no worse than that of at least one much- admired critic of to-day. And the Edinburgh had sensibility enough to feel that the poem was full of freshness- the freshness that you never get in England, for it rains so incessantly that you never know what makes the memory ache to remember, the scent of the long-dry dust when the showers strike it. Shelley was worse reviewed than Keats, was the
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_45_1	one poet who did receive real injustice, for reasons other than his poetic sins. But his poetic sins were not small. Adonais and the West Wind came late in his life; early came Queen Mab, The Revolt of Islam, and Prometheus Unbound.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_46_0	"Here let me digress, and ask to have the commentators, those who teach and annotate our ""classics,"" put into the dock beside the reviewers. It is certain that a great many of the best criticisms of books are spoken, and never come into print. But people who in their school- days disliked stuff that they were told was admirable assume that poetry is ""not in their line,"" and they never vex themselves with it thereafter. It is Shakespeare's worst literature that we read first; and, reading in the editor's ""Preface"" what glorious stuff The Merchant of Venice is, and how divine the rhetorical-thoroughly competent, but brassy, unrhythmical, prosaic-speeches in Julius Caesar are, most of us, knowing that in our soul we are uncomfortable, blame the soul (that spark of God!) for an unpoetic, blinded thing, but nevertheless avoid verse when school-days are done. Dr Johnson, the best of all commentators on Shakespeare, long ago told the truth about Cymbeline:"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_47_0	This play has many just sentiments, some natural dialogues, and some pleasing scenes, but they are obtained at the expense of much incongruity.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_48_0	To remark the folly of the fiction, the absurdity of the conduct, the confusion of the names and manners of different times, and the impossibility of the events in any system of life, were to waste criticism upon unresisting imbecility, upon faults too evident for detection, and too gross for aggravation.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_49_0	"That is, Cymbeline is a thoroughly botched and bad piece of work, and only the miracle of the poetry surrounding Imogen has hidden this from general awareness. The Merchant of Venice is not this, of course-""unresisting imbecility""; but it is not poetry, and we ought to be told this in our school-days-and told it in the plainest language. Johnson's truthfulness is needed in all the teaching of our established poetry. When correcting a number of papers by elementary school teachers a few years ago, I was struck by their obvious dislike—often almost hatred-of Shelley; but not one of them dared say what he thought, for fear that the examiner would plough him. Yet what he thought would have been far better sense, had he known, than the official judgments that he had learnt by heart and which he set down-not even then managing to hide altogether the wrigglings of distaste and unbelief. These men, who had been to no university and no public school, dared not say how dull and poor they had quite reasonably, in the examiner's opinion-found Prometheus Unbound; it made me unhappy, for I knew that they would never again voluntarily read any poetry, and that they would pass on their own vivid horror of it. They considered that they had to praise also that detest- able poem, Isabella. But we who review books are equal cowards. Every book that has won lofty praise in the last eight years ought to be reviewed again. It would be"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_49_1	"good for us to decide if Ralph Hodgson's Bull really is the altogether delectable and glorious thing we were told not so long ago; if the concluding chorus of The Dynasts really is sublime; if The Death of Society (for prose should come up too) deserved the Hawthornden Prize and the praise given it recently by a pontifical person, that either this or A Passage to India is ""the most distinguished book"" of the last decade. We need honesty for the prevalent cults of the hour also. It would sift away a lot of nonsense if we said what we feel. Samuel Butler might then be seen to be just as much a preacher as Charles Haddon Spurgeon, and we might remember preachers who took themselves with less devastating solemnity and were more human and humorous creatures. Even Blake might seem less toweringly great than we are always being told he is, and the worship of Donne might seem a bit silly."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_50_0	Verifiable by observation, the fact is this; so much of contemporary reputation, more so now than ever before, is insincere, the repetition of what we have heard other, more prominently placed, dullards say, that often all that is needed to upset a reputation is for one man to challenge it with honesty and vigour. If he speaks like a man of sense and gives reason for his heresy, the trick is done. No one need be afraid of speaking his opinion of a contemporary poet frankly (or, for that matter, a novelist), if he has taken pains to be sure that it is his opinion and is grounded on first-hand investigation. There will be a few parrots crying that Mr Jones has shown not the poet's short-comings but his own-a few second-hand sarcasms will be flung at him, out of minds that are one vast rag-bag. But not ten per cent. of those who praise the work whose worth he questions have read it; and of these ten only one is sure of what the others have hitherto lightly assumed to be their opinion.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_51_0	Nevertheless, real reputations still exist. Conrad's was real, Kipling's is real; in poetry, Bridges' and de la Mare's are real. For these depend not on reviewers but on lovers, they have managed to get past the reviewers-an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. (Nor will it profit you to have got past, if you have got past because of their stupidity or fraud. Your reputation will be a sham one, waiting for the first man who can throw a stone straight.) Reviewers have often treated Mr Bridges scurvily; as he would say himself, it does not matter a damn. Those who know him know; and neither this nor any subsequent generation will ever be so completely fooled as to lose this knowledge. And we have other poets-a few-who are safe enough. A man is all right once he has found his public.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_52_0	POETRY FOR THE EAR; AND FOR THE EYE
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_53_0	Our poetry reviewers-and many of our poets-need to be jerked back to first principles. They do not know what poetry is. Wordsworth says:
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_54_0	All good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings; and, though this be true, poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who, being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility, had also thought long and deeply.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_55_0	That definition-like Arnold's, like any that could be made-is too narrow; but it includes two elements that are present in all great poetry, and in most good poetry, spontaneity and deliberateness. It is the spontaneity on which we need to insist to-day-not that we have a superabundance of the long brooding out of which poetry is born, but we have an abundance of cleverness. During the last dozen years a great deal of work has passed as poetry which is only carpentry. The technical difficulties of verse are trivial-of free verse, still more trivial-and can be mastered by anyone above a certain low grade of ability; good verse is common to-day, though nothing like as common as it was five years ago. Verse was then being written by a great many people, some of them gaining considerable reputation as poets, who ought to have left it alone. As Mr Robert Graves observed to me, poetry, like the building trade, suffered from dilution of labour. During the temporary boom in poetry (which has been followed by so utter a slump) some brilliant writers made their first hit with a smartly written book of verse; they then passed on to their real and more arduous job, and have since written novels, short stories, or essays. It is safe to prophesy that they will not vex the Muse again for this incarnation. They are under no illusion; they know they are not poets, though they have passed as such.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_56_0	"""Why, father, is the net removed?"" ""Son, it hath caught the fish."""
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_57_0	Verse is not, in its really poetical manifestations, an extraneous ornament, the work of deft brains. The mind has been stirred by an impulse that demands rhythmical expression; there have been waves of rhythm within, which create waves of rhythm in language. Just as certain movements of the mind cry out for music as their satisfaction, so others A cry out for poetry. If a man is a great poet, his verse corresponds-though not necessarily, or even usually, at once--to this thought as the movements of a vigorously healthy body correspond to the brain's direction; thought and I rhythmical impulse work as one. There must be a deliberate element, however hidden, or the rhythmical impulse could not appear as language. But that deliberate element in happy moments works so swiftly, incisively, and infallibly, that it becomes a second spontaneity; and, even when the poetry has resulted from hard effort, has the effect and virtue of spontaneity. So poetry must be read from within-not judged by externals, by the show it makes on the printed page.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_58_0	"Now, if the rhythmical core, impulse, beginning, whatever we decide to call it, is slight or almost non-existent, a good craftsman can still write what is good verse; English has a great deal of this kind of verse, much of it so pleasant that it achieves some of the function of poetry, and it would be ungrateful not to call it poetry. Nevertheless, true poetry is sign-marked by its rhythmical source, and a poet's prose-not that abomination ""poetic prose""-is, when it treats of a subject imaginatively and not merely analytically, a thing visibly excited even when triumphant, like a man marching in the Eleusinian Pro- cession. Poetry is for the ear, not primarily for the eye (though the eye may powerfully reinforce the appeal to the ear); and it is not for the outer ear (though this may have reason to rejoice in it), but for the inward ear that catches sounds subtler than any noise. And, when a contemporary has produced a genuine poem, this rhythm moves visibly through its words. The rhythm may be tremulous with happiness, as well as joyous with the writer's absolute command, as in"

2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_71_0	For some time, however, our reviewers have been misled by poetry that has been written for the eye; and it is through the eye that they judge of it. Verse that aims at giving the effect of colour, that splashes the printed page with vivid words, has been more readily accepted than any other. Good poets know well how the eye collaborates with the ear, and have often been glad to use words that deceive a sense-that of seeing-which is continually forcing itself (wrongfully) into an assessor's position. Results have sometimes justi- fied them; but it is a dangerous trick, for soon the eye takes control and the inner ear is forgotten. Then the poet will collect his poem from the world outside, and it will remain a thing external. Mr W. J. Turner's poetry is like no one else's, and his earlier books had their own elegiac rhythm acting on the reader like a charm, so that he was drowsed with pleasure; but there was an attention to colour that has since grown excessive. Here are typical lines from his earlier work:
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_72_0	Carved on the azure air white peacocks fly, Their fanning wings stir not the crystal trees, Bright parrots fade through dimming turquoise days, And music scrolls its lightning calm and bright On the pale sky where thunder cannot come.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_73_0	"This excessive appeal to the eye was present in nearly all the poets of the ""Georgian Poetry"" books. Now, because the sense of beauty weakens so easily, it is legitimate to strengthen it by whatever appeal; but the subsidiary appeal should not displace the soul and source of poetry. This needs the more emphasis, because our world is so amazingly rowdier than any world in which poets have lived before. Motor-cars honk, each with its separate discordance, along even the Damascus-Beirut road, Lebanon being now one of the seven noisiest places on earth. In Oxford I sit daily, three storeys up in a side street, trying to teach an Oriental tongue, and I have to shout to be heard by men a yard away. I do not think we have begun to suspect how obtuse and hardened our sense of sound values has become; the more need, then, to keep some awareness in the inward ear."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_74_0	We shall not get better poetry unless we get better criticism of it. A novelist practising his art gets a great deal of criticism that helps him; a poet gets none. If a poet is praised at all, it is usually for things that really show the line along which he is going presently to be precipitated to the abyss. Even in the case of poets whom we have been reading for years, so that we ought to know what they are, the odds are that they will be esteemed for what is least estimable. Hardy is alleged to be a great poet because of The. Dynasts, or even because of his Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall; de la Mare, who is always delightful but who is so- beyond all comparison-infinitely more glamorous and delightful in fifty other poems, is praised for his fairies, and the anthologist will ask for Suppose oftener than for any poem except The Listeners. Suppose comes from the one bad patch he has struck, those fairy pieces written to illustrate certain ugly pictures. Of our modern fairies-which are not the fairies of A Midsummer Night's Dream—words adequately objurgatory have been uttered by Mr Kipling and Mr Forster. If so august a commination service is open to members of the public, I should like to lift my voice in the responses; it would be fervent. Drayton and Herrick have a lot to answer for.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_75_0	It is time we sorted out our opinions of the poetry of our time. We have taken over a deal of verse from the War, when all of us had so much hysteria and false sentiment in our minds. Verse has the trick of making nonsense stick like a burr. We have long ago forgotten the equally silly excitements that we all poured into newspapers, speeches, private letters; but our anthologies keep in everlasting remembrance Miss Rose Macaulay's Many Sisters to Many Brothers:
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_76_0	Oh, it's you that have the luck, out there in blood and muck: But for me- a war is poor fun!

There is another Nichols who wrote The Sprig of Lime, a poem masculine and all one piece, magnificent in rhythmic march, thought, and imagination; if any poet of his generation has written another poem as great, I should like to know its name.

It is certain that no poetry is being published now that is first-rate, unless our reviewers have overlooked it. Mr Leonard Woolf has recently written that in his opinion no masterpiece-he is thinking of prose mainly, of course— is written without some central core of faith or religion or philosophy-call it what you will, but it must be something that keeps the whole book ""at an even temperature."" We cannot get that; and those of us who are writing are humbly aware that we have nothing like enough to say, for the space in which we must say it."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_94_0	"Not that we would live, even for the gain of their spiritual fervour, the lives our predecessors lived. The Daily Herald this year, contrasting Mr Hardy's achievement with Browning's, called the latter ""a full-fed Liberal loafing on a hill-top in Fiesole and proclaiming that 'God's in His Heaven; all's right with the world,"""" and spoke of his ""silly optimism."" Poor Browning suffers as unjustly from misapplication of a remark, merely one in a sequence of phenomena, a sort of inventory of the universe at a certain moment-"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_95_0	The lark's on the wing: The snail's on the thorn: God's in his heaven-
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_96_0	"as Lord Oxford from misapplication of his famous ""Wait and see.” But we all have a certain sympathy with the Daily Herald's outburst. The universe has been taken from us. Instead, we have a world that, as a lady said to me, ""is daily being tied by radio and all that sort of thing into a nasty, tight little ball."" No wonder concetti are coming back, and are being hailed as masterly imaginativeness. The plain truth is, we haven't a philosophy that will carry a great poem."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_97_0	But while we wait for such a philosophy to come, something can be done to restore Cock Robin. If poetry is not publishable until the writer has made a name as a novelist or critic, or unless he is prepared to pay for it, then we are losing poetry. There must be at this present moment good poets whose names are quite unknown. Our dearth of genuine poetry has an economic cause, more immediate¹ than even its philosophic one; men who could write -in some cases, have written-poetry full of beauty, even if not of a quality that we dare call great, must write prose, as Hardy did for a quarter of a century, because they could not afford to write verse. If they ever return to verse, it will be with poetical muscles stiffened, as he did. And, though even in the stiffness there may be an impressive strength, there has been mean- while a loss. And they may never return.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_98_0	"There is a further loss to both the poet and his generation. One reason why poetry, if praised at all, is often overpraised by the writer's contemporaries is this: every writer whose work is really alive has something to say which is for his own contemporaries and for no one else. If his own age does not listen to him, then that part of his quality has been definitely lost. It was good that Byron and Swinburne were appreciated by men and women who felt the same excitements; for many of those excitements to us who have followed seem much ado about nothing. It is only my contemporaries who have lost what I have lost, who have learned what I have learned; so, if I have anything at all to say, part of it will be understood by them only. When we see the rust of oblivion encroaching on the work of men and women as near to us as Carlyle and Ruskin, Emerson, Tennyson, Browning, George Eliot, Charlotte Brontë, we may be glad they got so much recognition when alive, so that the part of their work which makes little appeal to us nevertheless made its appeal, and so became part of the inherited experience of the English. In the full tide of their reputation they seemed altogether ""immortal"" to their contemporaries, as Stephen Phillips and William Watson seemed twenty-five years ago, as Thomas Hardy and de la Mare and John Galsworthy seem to us to-day. But the coming"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_98_1	"of new, un- imaginable experience shreds away first this, and then that. There is no wise writer who does not remember the words spoken to Sapphira; the feet of the young men who are to bury him are at the door. When I told a poet and critic, in the first days of th ""sixpennies,"" that Rupert Brooke was selling more than the rest of the batch put together, he said in surprise, ""I thought the Brooke bubble had been pricked long ago!"" If Brooke had been alive, he could not have thought that, for a personality so vigorous and alert would have been still a force in our letters; Brooke would not yet have been forty. But Brooke was dead; and his critic had been too young when the War broke out to know what Brooke felt, and why others of us-who can see clearly enough all that can be urged against Brooke's work-are yet not prepared to dismiss it as rhetorical and empty."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_99_0	I have said that there are almost certainly good poets in our midst who have never had even the beginnings of a hearing. If there are, then their work, if it misses its own generation, will miss all generations. The dullest Elizabethan had, and still has, a chance; some kindred ass in our own time may discover him. But let no poet who is neglected to-day think that his work is going to be fished out of the bottomless forgetfulness of the future. It will be a long time before the thesis-writers are allowed to take our age, or anything written in it, as a subject; and when time has at last made us respectably ancient, so that even a university- even Oxford or Cambridge, even Harvard or Yale or Princeton-will think there is no shame in a scholar knowing that we once existed, mankind will have so many graver troubles to vex it that our bones will be left in peace. Besides, we are so numerous. No; for every writer, it is now or never.
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_100_0	"Therefore, to bring back poetry and to give us more good poetry we all need to mend our ways. Publishers must publish it again; and I am afraid they must publish it, if it is in such volume as it usually is, not at the present prices but at 3s. 6d., as Masefield's earlier books were published. The public must buy it. In England we cannot have-and do not want-a ""Book of the Month Club."" But it would not be a bad thing if some thousands of the people who can afford to buy poetry pledged themselves to buy a volume of new verse every four months—three a year. And they should not be allowed to consider that they had come within the meaning of the Act, if they had bought a book by Mr Kipling, Mr Masefield, Mr Humbert Wolfe, Mr Alfred Noyes, Mr John Oxenham, or Miss Fay Inchfawn; writers of so considerable a public should not be allowed to count, since they would be bought anyhow. The poets, too, must see to certain things; people often complain that the post-War popularity of poetry was strictly controlled by a few who made a close ring. Since in the nature of things writers of verse are likely to be reviewers of it also, they must see to it that the public gets weaned of its present profound distrust and suspicion of verse reviews. For the public is suspicious; and with reason, for it has had some grievous bunkum palmed"
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_100_1	"off upon it. It will not do to praise a poet enthusiastically, and then illustrate your praise with excerpts that every reader can see are commonplace or downright bad. If we continue to do this, there will never be any revival; that scarce creature, ""the lover of poetry,"" who now is so continually having his attention drawn to a book that ""he cannot afford to miss,"" will go on being blind to his interests, and will never turn up at the bookseller's counter."
2-13-cock-robins-decease	doc_27_101_0	Lastly, editors must send poetry out to be reviewed. At present every poet and every publisher knows that they do not. Better have abusive reviews, or silly reviews, than no reviews at all.

1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_1_0	NOTES ON SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VERSE AND PROSE
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_2_0	I
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_3_0	HAVE never, in all my life, been able to write a single line of verse; though I have written volumes, too many, of prose. While, as regards reading, instead of my ever-ready appetite for prose I discover in myself a slight initial unwillingness when it comes to verse. This personal idiosyncrasy, and doubtless inborn defect, of my constitution, is as well confessed at the outset of the present essay. Because, besides fitly introducing my views about verse and prose, it brings into relief the paradoxical fact of my always having, and always having had, a sense of inferiority, as towards poetry, and those who write it. I am acutely aware of belonging to a lower caste; and that my walk in life is, however honourable, humble and decidedly humdrum. This is not, I hasten to explain, because I have been dazzled by poets in private life: their person and conversation have always struck me as much of a muchness with those of ordinary mortals, among whom I should not be disinclined to count them. Yet, while so doing, something would stop me. However close their resemblance to human beings, there remains an unaccountable difference, something like an aura of immortality, about them. Nay, though experience may have shorn those who write verses of some of their individual prestige in my eyes, I have merely transferred the lyre and laurel-crown, the divine stature and radiance, from themselves to their art. Poetry may doubtless be more boring than prose, but it bores
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_3_1	me as I might be bored in a sanctuary. It is godlike, immortal.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_4_0	Godlike, methinks, because it is immortal. And immortal (such is the contention of the present essay), because one remembers it; because it survives in the memory, dwells, thrones there, in state. Whereas prose just comes and goes ; does its honest (or dishonest) work of altering something in our mind, and, having done that, fades away. So that, however great and enduring its effects, prose is, itself, no better than mortal.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_5_0	The different status of verse and prose is so much taken for granted that, far from inquiring into its origin, our learned critics rarely so much as point out the bare existence of such a difference. It is therefore left to an ignoramus in poetical lore, namely myself, to ask how you, or any of us, would feel on reading in The Times an important emendation in the text, first folio and all subsequent editions, of a famous passage in Midsummer Night’s Dream, making it read as follows :
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_6_0	“The prose-writer’s eye, rolling in a fine frenzy, glances from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven, in such a manner that when he sees in his mind’s eye forms which he has never seen elsewhere, his pen can turn them into bona-fide shapes, giving to airy nothingness a place and name.”
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_7_0	What drivel! we exclaim; what sacrilegious caricature! Really, people ought not to be allowed, etc., etc. Of course not! Still it is not so much the contents of this monstrous piece of nonsense which makes it sound nonsensical ; since, when you come to think of it, quite a lot of prose-writers have displayed just such imaginative power, making us accept the existence in time and space of persons and things existing nowhere outside their head. It is therefore the way in which the thing is said which makes it shocking; particularly the attribution to the prose-writer of a Rolling Eye, let alone a condition of Frenzy, fine or not fine. Such remarks should evidently be applied only to poets. Which is exactly what I have been driving at ; only a poet can have an Eye, at least a Rolling Eye, or at least an Eye Rolling in Fine Frenzy, for it is possible to roll one’s eyes, if not one at a time, without being in a frenzy, or without the frenzy being a fine one.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_8_0	And now I have got you to admit that much, namely, that poets are to this extent different from such of us as write only prose, we may go on to inquire how this comes about. So, returning to the proposed emendation, we find that it not only states what is obviously untrue, namely, that a prose-writer can have an eye rolling in a fine frenzy. It does much worse; for, by translating blank verse into prose, it turns a memorable poetic description into tautology and drivel. Since as, in prose, forms and shapes are, in such context, convertible terms, to say that the poet’s pen turns forms of imagined things into shapes, ‘airy nothing.” The adjective visible or bona fide, intercalated in the prose version does indeed get rid of the tautology and puts some meaning into the remark. But that meaning is commonplace, not worth mentioning ; above all it is not Shakespeare’s meaning. For of course we all know Shakespeare never meant that the poet’s pen, with or without the assistance of his rolling eye, could turn forms into shapes, nor even turn imaginary forms into bona-fide shapes. Shakespeare meant, of course, that the poet can make us accept as real what exists only in his own head... . Did Shakespeare mean that? It sounds a bit dull; and as already remarked it might be said with equal truth about the prose-writer, to whom neither Shakespeare nor anyone else would have attributed a rolling eye and a
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_8_1	state of frenzy. It seems less easy than one expected to make quite sure of what Shakespeare did mean to say. But only think of how he said it: the miraculous pat felicity of that “local habitation and a name” which everyone quotes daily; the enchanting grace of that ‘airy nothing”; the dignified passion of that “in a fine frenzy rolling” ; the great lyric swing of the whole passage. All that could never have been said about a prose-writer ; only about a poet.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_9_0	Moreover, only by a poet, never by a prose-writer. And that is what I was driving at in making that sacrilegious translation from verse into prose: my contention that there is in all this business a magical power at work transcending that which Shakespeare attributes to the eye, the fine frenzy, and whatever they stand for, of the poet. I mean the power of verse as verse to transform the obvious into the memorable, to call forth and justify far-fetched (occasionally doubtful) metaphors and high-flown descriptions. The power of verse as verse to turn him who employs it from a prose-writer into a poet.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_10_0	Come, come! here interrupts orthodox criticism, that is really pushing paradox just a little too far! Nothing is an older-established truth, older than Aristotle, Horace, Longinus, and modern critical science, than that the employment of verse has never made a poet. There has to be, in the first place, and before we can so much as begin talking of poetry, ever so much else, ever so much more important—in short, everything besides verse which is necessary to make a poet. Of course. Far be it from me to deny it. All I humbly maintain is that when you have all the everything else which is needed to make a poet, you do not get him unless you add that fact of his writing in verse. Indeed, I more than suspect that the mere writing in verse is what sets that poet’s eye rolling and puts him into a fine frenzy; or, since I must express myself in prose, gives the rein to his imagination, calls forth new and audacious expressions, sets the brain into more complex activity, puts the blood into rather more of a tumult, and brings to the aid of that poet-man’s individual powers the virtues inherent in artistic forms fashioned by scores of previous poets and—{which is as important)—accepted, cherished by generations of listeners and readers. It is the use of verse which makes the poet feel (even if the feeling be delusion) that he is a poet, and which secures an audience accustomed to grant poetic
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_10_1	license. Moreover, the use of verse means, on the part of the reader, readiness for a special kind of enjoyment involving a maximum of sympathy and goodwill, a minimum of the critical activity with its perpetual stop: what does that mean ?
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_11_0	II
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_12_0	Never having written any poetry myself, I can speak of the poet’s fine frenzies only from hearsay and inference. But having read, indeed still reading, poetry with occasional enjoyment, I can speak from my own experience about the especial condition, quite different from that set up by the prose-writer, which the employment of verse produces and insists upon in the reader. To begin with, and reverting to Shakespeare’s verses about the Poet’s Eye and my prose translation of the same, I think we found that the statement in question when made in prose challenged, and even succumbed to, criticism ; whereas, made in verse, it imposed unquestioning acceptance. Why? Because, among other reasons, rhythm, and in lesser degree every other kind of verbal symmetry, makes us expect repetition of a given effect and thereby prepare ourselves for ourselves for making a given response ; expectation and preparation, if repeated, eliciting a degree of imitative activity on our part, we set to marching at that particular pace, and metaphorically, if not literally, dancing that particular step. Become thus docile, surrendering all choice, we forget all alternatives, and our lost initiative is compensated by an increase of ease and certainty such that we feel ourselves, while merely obeying, ten times stronger, freer, and more purposeful. This psychological fact is at the bottom of all art, as well as of quite other matters. With regard to poetry, this particular docile activity on our part extends our acquiescence to everything happening to be connected
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_12_1	with the symmetry, the rhythm which has set it up. Metre induces us to accept not only itself in its recurrence, but also whatever meaning that metre happens to vehicle. This, however, is only half of this queer business: Expecting implies, of course, remembering ; and the fulfilled expectation drives home the remembrance. Remembrance, moreover, induces twofold acceptance; hence, ceteris paribus, a twofold sense of the importance, the inevitableness of the statement which the recurrent metre has made us willing to accept. There is a cogency in all verse, according to the degree we feel it to be verse; and, of course, most of all in rhymed verse. Thus—
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_13_0	‘ Early to bed and early to rise Makes men healthy, wealthy, and wise ”
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_14_0	is fraught with deep significance. We accept and would fain apply such immemorial wisdom. But turn it into prose: ‘Going to bed and getting up early ensures health, riches, and wisdom to men,” and, behold, I at once question the truth of such an assertion. Where is its former profundity, its imperative? Gone, alas, with the metre and the rhyme, gone with our verse-inspired acquiescence. THE POET’S EYE
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_15_0	But verse does more than render the dictum of a poet —even of that nameless ancient poet I have just quoted —unassailable and memorable. Verse lifts the matter of discourse, because it lifts the hearer and reader, out of the tentative perfunctoriness of every day, where our thoughts, save for practical results, are merely transitive and mainly unimportant ; in themselves empty like those connecting words, the ands and buts, therefores and notwithstandings which weave the items of prose into close logical relation and values. ‘The world of verse is one of intrinsic values, and its relations are directly to our feelings. And our feelings get enclosed by the symmetrical recurrence of stress and sound in a charmed circle wherein nothing need connect with anything else and all becomes important in its own right. Meanwhile, once enclosed in the magic maze of verse as verse, our spirit moves in that verse’s motions, in modes as much more definite and continuous as dancing compared with walking. ‘Thus does the mere patterned movement of verse insufflate us with energy transcending our own; it sweeps us up to regions otherwise inaccessible to our jogtrot thoughts and affections, into regions where whatever we long for is realised and where whatever takes place is right.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_16_0	What wonder, therefore, if mere men and women like ourselves, the least legitimate descendant of Shakespeare, the dowdiest great-grandniece of Sappho, appear to our eyes, when they issue from such regions, crowned, hooded with superhuman effulgence like that of Moses descending from the mountain.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_17_0	Neither should we make too sure that this is but delusion on our part, and that they are the mere commonplace fellow-creature afterwards revealed in daily life. Poetry is not daily life, even when fit only for the wastepaper basket. I am ready to put my hand (wielding, alas, but a prose-pen !) in the fire if verse as verse does not act first and foremost on him who writes it, carrying him, as it carries us, into those exalted, unquestionable regions. In prosiest prose, and speaking as a psychologist, I think it probable that the creature thinking in verse thinks in a manner at once less trammelled and more sustained than we do; thinks thoughts different from ours, plunging into depths, soaring to giddy heights; and very often babbles sublimities which he would be at a loss to explain. (And which we, in our turn, are sometimes as much at a loss!) He—I mean the poet—certainly permits himself to do things forbidden to other folk, of which rolling his eye is the most unusual but not, when you come to think of it, the most indelicate. ... Nay, do we not expect the poet to pour out for our entertainment his privatest emotions such as the prose-writer barely ventures to embody in imaginary personages? Is it not the literary critic’s welcome task to nose out in every line an allusion to light-o’-loves and faithless friends ? And does not Browning’s refusal in “‘ House and Shop” strike us as
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_17_1	positive incivility ?
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_18_0	Leaving the poet thus to pin upon his sleeve that ornate paper valentine he calls a heart, let me revert to that remark of mine (since it sums up my thesis) that in poetry all that isis right. Right even, as anyone translating verse so often finds, when which of two senses of a word is not made clear by the context (Browning’s splendid “ flat on the nether springs ”). Right when grammar and common sense come tumbling over each other like Goethe’s “Es Stiirzt der Fels und iiber ihn die Flut.” Right even when a comparison is an absurdity, like Baudelaire’s “La nuit s’épaississait ainsi qu’une cloison.” Right when we could not swear what the poet is driving at, as Dante with his “Amor che a nullo amato amar perdona.” Right when Shelley apostrophises his lark “ Bird thou never wert.” . . . All of which is right, unquestionable, unassailable, unalterable, perfect and plusquam-perfect when it is in verse. But a thing to run one’s blackest pencil through, to be endlessly corrected or everlastingly effaced, if in prose.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_19_0	III
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_20_0	And now having started this most prosaic inquiry with Shakespeare’s high-flown eulogy on those who really are poets, duly frenzied and rolling-eyed, let me end with Wordsworth’s more reasonable remarks about those other persons who might have been poets but aren’t. I quote from the second book of the Excursion, v. 76:
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_21_0	“Oh, many are the poets that are sown By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts, The vision and the faculty divine ; Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse Which, in the docile season of their youth, It was denied them to acquire, through lack Of culture and the inspiring aid of books, Or haply by a temper too severe, Or a nice backwardness afraid of shame, Nor having e’er, as life advanced, been led By circumstance to take unto the height The measure of themselves, these favoured Beings, All but a scattered few, live out their time Husbanding that which they possess within, And go to the grave, unthought of. . . .”
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_22_0	I have chosen this passage because, first of all, it confirms my contention that a poet 7s a poet only if he writes in verse, since Wordsworth ascribes the melancholy miscarriage of these “ men endowed with highest gifts” to their “‘ wanting the accomplishment of verse.” Lacking that accomplishment (as it is called by this contemporary of Miss Pinkerton’s Academy for Young Ladies), lacking that, there is nothing for it but to “ go to the grave unthought of.” I have, however, a second, subtler, and more intrinsic reason for choosing that quotation—to wit, that these prosaic expressions, “highest gifts,” “inspiring aid of books,” “led by circumstance,” and these prosy platitudes become tolerable and even impressive because, well! because Wordsworth did zot “Jack the accomplishment of verse.” Being poetry, they roll along, wave upon wave, solemn, majestic, no matter what poor drift and drivel they leave behind for disappointed treasure-seekers. More particularly, there is in this quotation one verse which, turned into prose by the transposition of a single word—“ the vision and the divine faculty ”—becomes flat and foolish enough, calling forth the immediate criticism that as the poet’s vision is an essential part of his “ faculty,” the one cannot be added to the other. As prose that is bad prose; but as verse that line can be adequately described only by quoting itself; for does it not irradiate the whole passage just with “ the vision and the faculty divine ” ?
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_23_0	IV
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_24_0	Let no one imagine, as everyone will, that this is the voice of envy—to wit, that of the prose-writer embittered by lack of rolling eyes and fine frenzies. Or if it be envy, then only such as Keats felt towards his nightingale : “Envy of thy happy lot, but being too happy in thy happiness.’
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_25_0	Indeed, since we are discussing the difference between prose and verse, the above may be the only, though symbolical, meaning plain prose can extract from that verse which (according to my view) Keats, inasmuch as a poet, had a right to make as obscure as ever he pleased.
1-17-poets-eye	doc_28_26_0	Whereby I mean that, while just a little envious thereof, I am delighted that poetry should enjoy certain happinesses denied to prose, because I enjoy the spectacle of them as Keats enjoyed the song, which he could not emulate, of that nightingale. Since it is a high happiness for all of us, even for prose-writers, to be occasionally delivered, if only by proxy, from the trammels, traps, and pitfalls of logic among which our thoughts pick their timid way; and charioted by the divine winged steeds of rhythm and rhyme, to career freely in poetry’s interstellar spaces, yonside of sense and nonsense.

It has been, and is, the universal practice in civilized countries to imprison the criminal, who will not act, and the lunatic, who will not think, like his neighbours. Thus is the criminal tamed, the hooligan civilized, and the lunatic either learns to think like those outside the asylum - in which case he is discharged with a certificate of sanity - or he continues, until removed by the great tamer, death, to think like his immediate neighbours, his fellow lunatics.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_3_0	Civilization consists in acting and thinking like the ordinary man — the ordinary man being, in this connecton, obviously an ordinary man or woman of the upper middle classes. The more people who act and think like the ordinary man or woman who is born in Onslow Square or Cadogan Gardens, the more civilization; and if people persist in behaving as if they had been born in the jungle, in utopia, or in the Kingdom of Heaven, they must be shut up under sentence by a judge or magistrate or under a certificate signed by a doctor and a Justice of the Peace. Our judges, magistrates, prison authorities Justi Magistrates, prison authorities can give innumerable instances in which a few weeks or months confinement have so changed some fellow who had been behaving like a savage that you could not have known that he had not lived all his life in South Kensington.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_4_0	The object of putting wild animals in cages and of exhibiting them behind iron bars in Zoological Gardens is not primarily to tame them and civilize them. The main laudable object of the Zoological Society is to provide them a place where civilized children (half price) and civilized (one shilling) may spend an afternoon of pleasure combined with instruction and deposit the paper bbags in wire receptacles specially constructed for the purpose. But the civilizing power of solitary confinement and imprisonment cannot be confined to the vertebrate bipeds called human beings, and the Zoo has a profound effect upon its permanent inhabitants. Those who have seen the leopard glide swiftly and savagely through the jungle, or an elephant go crashing brutally through the undergrowth, will hardly recognise as the same creatures that great, immobile, meditative cat in the Lion House and that great swaying mass stretching out its trunk through the wooden bars of the Elephant House for a penny bun. Indeed, the observant vistor to the Lion House may notice that it and its inhabitants have acquired something of that sombre melancholy and dingy respectability which is so overpowering in Cromwell Road and Onslow Square, and, without being too fanciful, he may even detect in the eye of the lions staring into space a gleam of the same look which one sometimes sees through a South Kensington window in the eye of an old gentleman pretending to read the Sunday paper behind a white lace curtain.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_5_0	"So civilized have the animals become that, after the Gardens have closed for the night, many of them contrive to meet together in a kind of debating society, the object of which is mutual instruction and improvement. Only those are admitted to membership whose spirits are completely tamed by confinement and civilization: experience has shown the necessity of excluding, for instance, those animals, natives of Asia and Africa, who are not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world and whose personal habits are offensive, and also the lower classes of even European animals whose smell is naturally unpleasant. It has been regretfully decided also to exclude all the larger carnivora, although, as the aristocratic antelope admitted, they are nearly all ""gentlemen and white men""; but the sombre, meditative melancholy which affects these animals in captivity is liable occasionally to turn into homicidle irascibility, just as in South Kensington occasionally the old gentlemen ‘go mad and kill their wives.'"
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_6_0	The discussions among the animals admitted to membership almost always come back to one subject, Man. The existence, nature, and mysterious ways of Man have always been, and still are, a source of difficulty and dispute among the animals. At first it was universally believed that men were a kind of spirit, or as we might almost say, gods, who were responsible for all the inexplicable events which happened so regularly in the Zoo. Obviously the keepers were the givers and withholders of food and drink, meted out rewards and punishments, and, by opening and shutting the doors, were the creators of day and night. Then one of the zebras suddenly began to believe that the many men were only an illusion, and that really there was only one omnipotent Man, sitting in a large building invisible in the Zoo and appearing to the animals in the form of keepers and visitors. This belief spread like wildfire, and eventually one of the warthogs announced that he had actually discovered the name of this Man, and that he was called Mitchell ; that Mitchell was, however, too sacred a name ever to be uttered, and that in conversation or prayer he had to be addressed as “ Secretary to the Zoological Society.” For a long time after this all the animals believed that there was only one Man, who had created the universe and the Zoo and whose name was “‘ Secretary to the Zoological Society.”
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_7_0	The snakes are, however, temperamentally agnostic, and one of the Russell’s Vipers (Daboia elegans) known familiarly as Bertie, some time ago put forward the theory that there was no one omnipotent Man, but only men, and he supported his opinion in such a brilliant speech and with such coldly conclusive logic that he convinced all the more advanced animals who were members of the debating society. This trend of thought was carried a step further by the orang-outang, a cynical and savage pessimist, who, after hanging upside down on the bars of his cage for the better part of an afternoon and staring fixedly and ferociously at the female visitors, at the next meeting stated his opinion that men and women were animals just like themselves, and that, after careful study, he could see little difference, except in hair, and clothes, between a female orang-outang and the women who came into the Apes House, and personally he preferred the female to be both hairy and naked.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_8_0	The orang-outang’s theory was the cause of violent controversy, the discussion turning almost exclusively upon the resemblance of women to the females of the various species, The monkeys, deer, bears, and pigs were on the side of the orang-outang, but the male tortoise and male elephant remained for a long time unconvinced, passionately protesting that they could not conceive how a woman, hairy or not hairy, could perform the functions of a female tortoise or a female elephant. The orang-outang sardonically asked the elephant whether he could conceive of a female tortoise performing the functions of a female elephant, and would he therefore deny that tortoises were full members, however curiously formed (he intended no offence), of the great animal community and Zoo Society? The elephant made a dignified and angry reply in which he did not meet the orangoutang’s point. Such nervous exaltation and irritability manifested itself among the members that all the females were asked to withdraw, but even this did not produce calm or eS of feeling, and the discussion was adjourned sine die.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_9_0	At the next meeting it was unanimously agreed that the subject of sex should in future be absolutely barred from discussion. There followed many debates upon the orang-outang's theory. It rapidly gained ground, and one result of the new doctrine was an intensive study of the history, habits, and customs of human beings. The Secretary Bird and the Long Eared Owl were the first animals who taught themselves to read. Visitors to the Zoo are often careless or absent-minded, and any book or newspaper dropped in one of the houses was eagerly seized upon and added to the public library. The monkeys often succeeded in purloining volumes from the pockets of visitors. Communication was opened with the sparrows who frequent the gardens in great numbers and yet have free access to the outside world, and an agreement was easily reached by which a news service was organized under the direction of the Secretary Bird, the sparrows collecting current information in Fleet Street, in the West End among the clubs, and in Whitehall, and bringing it to the Zoo in return for a fixed share of the animals’ food. A precis of the day’s news was made under the direction of the Secretary Bird and read out at the - each meeting.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_10_0	All the animals were greatly interested in the war; it affected their food supply and so brought home to them its immense importance as a struggle between right and wrong, between the ideals of militarist tyranny and democratic freedom. They studied and discussed its deeper causes and effects, and in the process acquired a considerable amount of historical knowledge. Later Bolshevism took the place of the war as a subject of debate, and the General Election of 1924 caused the keenest discussions. I propose to give here a somewhat curtailed account of the debate which was held immediately after the final results of that election became known.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_11_0	The Rhinoceros, a slow and deliberate speaker, who is almost invariably supported by the Hippopotamus, opened the discussion :—
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_12_0	“I rejoice,’’ he said, ‘‘ that this Baldwin and his species have won so overwhelming a victory, and I am sure that things will rapidly go back — the only direction in which rapid progress is either safe or desirable — to the state of things which existed before the war and even earlier. Protection, as I have frequently explained, would be meaningless unless it meant, when combined with a tariff and taxes upon imported food, the protection of food, i.e., a cheaper and more abundant food supply. The logical result of the Conservative victory will he a high tariff all round, and I am sure that you will find in the next year that all tariffs in these Gardens, whether of the restaurants or of our Houses, will share in the increase,”’
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_13_0	There was a murmur of dissent from the orang-outang and several monkeys, whereupon the Hippopotamus opened his eyes and said in a loud voice, ‘Hear, hear!”
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_14_0	“ But,” continued the Rhinoceros, who, being extreme| short-sighted and even more hard of hearing, was rarely
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_15_0	conscious of interruptions or indeed of what was going on about him, “but I do not wish to discuss the subject of protection, about which we are all agreed. What I wish to talk about is these Russians or Bolsheviks. The appearance of this new species of animal in the world, like the appearance of everything new, is terrifying and spells disaster, and all I can say is that I thoroughly agree with the King, the Baldwins, the Northumberlands, the Banburys, the Poincarés, the ever-to-be-lamented Tsars, and all the other Conservative species of human animal which refuse to have anything to do with, or to recognize the existence of, these appalling creatures...'
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_16_0	‘I do not wish to appeat to boast,’ said the Ostrich in a genteel voice, ‘‘ but, if you will allow me to say so, does not that show the hereditary wisdom of my race which has taught us that the surest way of conquering fear and destroying evil is to shut our eyes to it?”
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_17_0	The Hippopotamus, who woke up as soon as the Ostrich began to speak, roared her interruption several times into the Rhinoceros’s ear and eventually succeeded in making him understand it.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_18_0	"‘There is undoubtedly something in what you say,"" he allowed. ‘‘To every species of God’s creatures""-- there was a loud laugh from the monkeys—‘‘its own peculiar, proper, and hereditary wisdom. It is well-known that my own race is is one of the oldest, and has always enjoyed the distinction of being short-sighted and rather deaf. We have learnt by age-long experience - I had an ancestor in the Pliocene Age who was an intimate friend of one of the greatest of the Pteropods — that on the appearance of anything new and terrible, on should stand still for a moment, look fixedly in the direction in which the evil appears to be — or if you are not sure in fixedly in any direction — and finally run away with a blind and magnificent rush. In this manner you may, quite possibly run over and destroy the evil, while, if it does not happen to get in your way; you will at least get out of its way. Simply to shut one's eyes, or, as I understand it, to bury one’s head in sand, is no doubt another method of attaining the same end. It is a very ancient method, and therefore has much to recommend it, but it happens not to have been adopted by the race of rhinoceros. However, I have nothing whatever to say against it."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_19_0	"""But let me return to the Bolsheviks. It is clear, I think, from our study of human beings that their species is suffering from a malignant disease of mutability, which for the last century and more, the monarchical, aristocratic “species have unsuccessfully attempted to hold in check. It all began, I understand from our friend the Long-Eared Owl, in 1789. A new and terrible human Species, the French revolutionaries, terrorists, or democrats, then suddenly sprang into existence. Human beings do not appear to possess that instinctive and hereditary wisdom that enables other animals to deal effectively, in one way or another, with things new and terrifying. The blind, magnificent rush is not theirs, nor have we observed any man or woman effectively bury its head in the sand. When they are afraid, instead of doing something, they all start talking among themselves as to the best way of destroying the new phenomenon. That is precisely what happened, I understand, at the time of the French Revolution: instead of destroying the new species or running away from it, or at least ignoring it, they tried to do all these things at the same ti me, and, in addition, to talk and argue and philosophize over the nature of the new phenomenon."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_20_0	‘’ The consequence was that this abominable revolution and democracy were never extirpated; the revolutionaries and democrats have continued to propagate their species and infect every nation of the world, But the root of the evil is this accursed habit of change among human beings. It is 50 years ago that another new and malignant species of human animal, the German, sprang into existence. Everyone, particularly the people of this country and the French, were immediately, and rightly, terrified of him. But the incredible behaviour of man is shown by the fact that, instead of trampling the Germans out of existence at once they went on arguing for 44 years about the “ German menace,”’ living for the better part of half a century in terror of their lives, spending immense sums of money on guns for shooting Germans, disputing whether one ought to shoot Germans or whether they had enough guns for shooting Germans, but never in all those long years shooting a single German. In fact, when the Chinese species, who do seem to have some hereditary wisdom, being terrified by the sudden appearance of two Germans talking about Jesus Christ at the other side of Asia, had the sense promptly to cut their throats, the rest of the world began shooting the Chinese until they compelled the survivors to give the Germans on of the richest provinces of China, pay them a large sum of money; and set up the statue of a German General in one
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_20_1	of their chief towns.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_21_0	"""Well, they lived in terror of these accursed Germans for 44 years, doing nothing at all, beyond shooting a few China-men and niggers in order to keep their courage up: and they would have continued to do nothing unless a Serbian had shot an Austrian prince — which caused all the guns tog off everywhere. In the panic which followed they began at last to shoot Germans, and, in the process, they seemed 0 learn some of the hereditary wisdom of my own race, making making magnificent blind rushes up and down the face of th for the better part of four years. But the mutability and changeability of the human animal are most distressing: After shooting Germans happily and contentedly for four years, they suddenly seem to have grown tired of it and, instead of completing the job satisfactorily when they had the chance, they allowed a large number of Germans to survive in Germany, and even to come to this country. The result is that people, particularly in France, are becoming as frightened of the Germans whom they have not killed as they were previously frightened of the Germans whom they have killed."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_22_0	"""To crown all, even before they had stopped killing Germans, there sprang into existence, in Russia this time, another new species of human animal, the most terrible and horrible that the world has ever known. The fundamental evil in the world is change. I cannot understand this senseless habit of change among man, of continually breeding new species or sub-species, Why,the Rhinoceros race has come and gone upon the face of the earth for hundreds and thousands of years — I had an ancestor who was famous in the Pliocene age - and whoever heard of a rhinoceros changing its hereditary wisdom or breeding a new type of rhinoceros? Seven or eight years ago one would have said that in Russia men were as wise as the Rhinoceros; for hundred of years they had altered nothing, the lower classes obeying and worshipping their Little Father, the Tsar. Then unexpectedly there springs up this obscene species of Bolshevik who want to change everything, to make the upper classes work for the lower classes, to take all our possessions away from us, and who have killed the Little Father, the Tsar."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_23_0	‘Obviously the appearance of this new species in Russia is the greatest menace which has threatened the world since the glacial period (which very nearly extinguished the race of rhinoceros, for large numbers of my ancestors were, at that time, caught in the ice and frozen to death in Europe). The terror which they inspire in this country is extremely sagacious, for fear is the beginning and the better part of wisdom. But the problem remains : what should the human animals in this country do? They might make a magnificent rush and trample the Russians out of existence, but I admit that there are difficulties in the way of doing this, owing to the sea and other things. Personally I should like to see them shoot the Bolsheviks, and all the workers and strikers here who support and copy them. (One of the few useful things which this human animal has invented is the gun, if he would only use it more often against his own sub-species and not so often against other animals.) The difficulty, however, as I understand it, is that the upper classes here are only too ready to shoot the lower classes in Russia who have alread sh their own upper classes, while the lower classes here have not yet been sufficiently frightened of the lower classes in Russia to agree to go and shoot them there. Pending the time, then, when the upper classes here shall have instilled into their lower classes that amount
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_23_1	of fear of the Bolsheviks which is the beginning of political wisdom, and will induce them to shoot Russians, I do not see that there is a better course to pursue than that adopted by this Baldwin and his Conservative species.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_24_0	“I hope I may be pardoned a short digression at this point. The sparrows tell us that this Baldwin has a passion for pigs. Now you may have observed that the pig is the only animal native to this country which remotely resembles a rhinoceros. The resemblance is exceedingly remote, but, stretching a point, I would not object if anyone said that the pig does resemble a minute and very inferior rhinoceros, if such a thing could exist. This being the case, it is not improbable that the brain of the English pig; of which we havé, unfortunately, no specimen among us, resembles the brain of a minute and very inferior rhinoceros. You will follow my argument when I now suggest that this Baldwin, and through him the Conservatives, have learnt a good deal of their political wisdom from the pigs.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_25_0	"“The policy of Baldwin and his species is a simple one. They are waiting for a time when the newspapers shall have made the lower classes sufficiently afraid and when it will be possible to use them to exterminate the Bolsheviks by shooting. Meanwhile, they keep up their own fear as well as they can ; they refuse to have anything to do with the Bolsheviks and, as far as possible, pretend that they do not exist. It is the only thing they can do. For political wisdom may be summed up in the following precepts: ‘ Fear the new and destroy it; if you cannot destroy it, run away if you cannot are away, shut your eyes and your ears.’ In other words the highest wisdom consists in a judicious mixture of fear, blindness, and deafness — a mixture which, if I may say so, has distinguished the race of rhinoceros ever since the Pliocene age."""
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_26_0	The Hippoptamus woke up and roared approval. The Tapir, Camel, Giant Sloth, Marmots, and most of the Deer applauded. A large number of Monkeys leapt to their feet gesticulating and all speaking at the same time. When order was restored, it was agreed that the Mandril should speak on behalf of the Monkeys. He then delivered the following oration, during which he continued, slowly and deliberately, to eat shrimps out of a paper bag :—
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_27_0	"""I am myself,” he said, ‘a Bolshevik. It is true that I belong to the intelligentsia among the races and tribes of apes and monkeys, but I have deliberately thrown in my lot with the proletariate. The lower classes eat shrimps, and that is why I eat shrimps out of this paper bag, even while I am speaking in public. If the Rhinoceros would forget his ancestors for a moment and eat shrimps, he would acquire a little more political wisdom,"
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_28_0	‘The only true thing which the Rhinoceros said was that fear is the beginning and end of political wisdom. But if the upper classes are afraid of the lower classes, the lower classes are even more afraid of the upper classes. The more fear, the more wisdom. That is why true political wisdom is found only among the common monkeys or common people. God is fear — and vox populi, vox Dei, If only all the workers of the world would unite — under the leadership of the Mandril — what terror they would inspire, what terror they would feel! It would be a universal Reign of Terror, a new Holy Roman Empire, a union of the British Empire and League of Nations, a universal socialized Soviet republic — in a word, the millenium.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_29_0	'For two thousand years or more the human proletariate has lived in terror of the upper classes, and with good reason. Our friend the Long-Eared Owl has taught us all a little history. Freemen and slaves, feudal lords and serfs, aristocrats and peasants, landowners and agricultural labourers, masters and men, employers and employed — it is all the same old story told and retold over again, ‘ The good things of the earth,’ say the first, ‘ and art and literature and music, by some divine dispensation, are for us, for we are the spirit which makes the wheels of the world go round; and you,’ they say to the second, ‘are the cogs and wheels; by some divine dispensation, it is your duty under our direction to go round; in the sweat of your brow shall you eat your bread. Did not Almighty God tell you so? Go round, go round, go round! We may regret that the world has been made in this way; but it is God or Nature or the Logic of Facts; it is not our fault. Go round!’
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_30_0	“ And they have been going round for two thousand years and more. Do you think they would have done so except through fear? And they have good cause for fear, for truly your Baldwins and conservatives, your Kings, Tsars, and capitalists, your aristocrats and land-owners and feudal lords know that God is fear and the rich man His prophet. We know what Luther and the upper classes of his time did when the proletariate stopped going round. ‘ Slaughter and stab them,’ cried Luther, ‘ openly or in secret; kill them as you would a mad dog.’ And they did; they slaughtered some hundred thousand and only stopped when the survivors began to go round once more. The Russian peasants have just learnt from Kolchak and Denikin that they can expect in the 20th century from the upper classes only what their ancestors got in the 16th.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_31_0	“ And the capitalist? What does the capitalist and behind him the capitalist Government say to the town worker? Work or starve! Work on our terms or starve on your own! There are the machines— our machines and our government and our police and our soldiers and our machine guns. God is fear and we are His prophets. 'Work—or strike and starve.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_32_0	5 ‘“ The proletariate learnt its lesson during the war. It learnt that guns can go off in more than one direction, If God is fear, the poor man with a gun in his hand can become a better prophet of God than the rich man without one. That is what has happened in Russia. The cogs and the wheels began to go round, but in the opposite direction; the guns went off, again in the opposite direction. For the first time in history the upper classes became more afraid of the lower classes than the lower of the upper. ‘ Work,’ said the proletariate to the Tsar and his capitalists, ‘ work—or strike and starve.’ It is a new and most divine dispensation.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_33_0	‘This Baldwin and his conservatives and capitalists do well to be afraid. A little wind has begun to blow in Russia which will shake the very bars of our cages before the hurricane is laid. But you cannot trample the wind out of existence, however magnificently blind is your rush, and the storm will not spare your back-side because you have buried the other end of you in the sand. Woe, I say, upon the backsides of the Baldwins and the capitalists and conservatives ! They are shutting their eyes not to evil, but to a hurricane of good. The day of the Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus and Kings, Tsars, landowners, and Capitalists, is over; the day of the common monkey and common people has dawned. It is true that I am not a common monkey ; you have only to observe the colouration of my face and back-side to see this. I belong to the intelligentsia. But I have thrown in my lot with the proletariate and I shall rejoice to be their leader now that their day has dawned.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_34_0	‘One word more—on the subject of change. I agree that most things which are new are terrifying. But all change is good. The race of monkeys has always been on the side of change. The rhinoceros, no doubt, has not changed since he had a distinguished ancestor in the Pliocene age; but that is not true of my race. We have always been breeding new races of monkeys. Why, you would hardly be able to tell from his appearance that the little brown monkey who resides in the third cage on the right in the monkey-house — I have a bad memory for names — belongs to the same race as myself. If the Pliocene ancestor of the Rhinoceros had but given a little more attention to the great and beneficent principle of change, the foundation of revolutions, his descendent to-day might have had blue wrinkles on his nose and a sky-blue rump. One of the most reliable of the Sparrows told me that both Lenin and Trotsky have that distinuished scheme of colouration.”
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_35_0	When the Mandril had finished, the monkeys screamed approval, waving their arms and all chattering together (they thought they were singing the ‘ Red Flag ’’). Savant animals rose to continue the debate, but the Elephant pointed out that the hour was late and called upon the Long-Eared Owl to make the last speech before he himself summed up the discussion. The Owl then spoke as follows :— ‘It is our custom in these discussions, after hearing the partisan opinion of animals who have taken one side or the other in the controversy under consideration, finally to refer the matter to one of the race of birds whose wings have enabled them to acquire the habit of rising ‘above the battle’ and of obtaining, from a safe distance, an impartial, bird’s-eye-view of the situation. I do not pretend myself to understand the extraordinary behaviour of the human race, whether of the Conservatives and capitalists or of the Bolsheviks and proletariate. From the point of view of a bird, man appears to be a most dangerous animal, so clever that he would have destroyed every living thing on the earth, including himself, if he had not been repeatedly saved by long lucid moments of extreme stupidity. For races and species of animals like ourselves, whose minds and habits have a natural stability, fully to understand this savage and unbalanced creature man, is, I believe, impossible; but it is occasionally possible to discover some partial explanation of his conduct if you examinehis
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_35_1	history.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_36_0	“In political questions, such as the one which we have been discussing, man appears to be more irrational and unstable than in any others, and to know something of his history is therefore of the greatest importance. By a fortunate accident an absent-minded visitor dropped near my cage the eight volumes of Sorel’s L'Europe et la Révolution Française, and I have therefore been able to study the history of that revolution which took place in France over 100 years ago, and which throws much light upon the Russian Revolution.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_37_0	“Now a study of man’s history shows, I think, that our friends the Rhinoceros and the Mandril, though right in some of their judgments, have made not unnatural errors regarding the irrational conduct of the human race. It is true that the human political organization is founded upon fear, and that when men talk about justice and reason and patriotism, they often really mean panic and terror. For instance, it is only when the majority are sufficiently frightened of a minority that they begin to call the latter criminals and to make laws against them, and then it becomes just to imprison or hang them. You can see this in their treatment of two of their sub-species, the bore and the murderer, both of whom they dislike. But they are frightened of the murderer and not of the bore—consequently they apply justice to the murderer by hanging him, while, as they are not afraid of bores, justice is not applicable to them. Again it has been found absolutely impossible to keep any of their nations patriotic unless it is kept terrified of some other nation (or preferably nations) and so keep up their patriotism. In fact one of the gravest charges against the Socialists and Bolsheviks has been that they started a doctrine called internationalism, maintaining that it was unnecessary for any nation or race to be afraid of any other. If this monstrous doctrine were accepted, the whole of the political Organization of human beings would collapse and the
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_37_1	common people would cease to be patriotic. The Conservatives at the last election saw this danger, and it was Only in the nick of time that one of their most intelligent diplomatists invented the ‘Zinovieff Letter,’ as it was called, and succeeded in making the common people once more afraid of the Russians, and so patriotic. France is, in fact, the only country in Europe where the political organization is in an absolutely sound state and patriotism permanent and unassailable. ‘The reason is that every Frenchman is innately and permanently terrified of the Germans, and therefore he has in his own heart a perpetual spring of pure and undefiled patriotism. Some foolish people after the war thought that Frenchmen might lose their fear and with it their patriotism because the Germans had been beaten so soundly that it would be impossible for anyone to be afraid of them. Events proved that dead and unborn Germans can be just as terrifying as live ones. If there has ever been the slightest sign of fear and patriotic fervour flagging in France, it has only been necessary for the statesmen to recall the acts of dead Germans, or to refer to the fact that 50 years hence 500,000 more German babies than French babies will be born every year into the world, and immediately the French people, roused to the highest pitch of terror and enthusiasm, have decided to conscript another 100,000 African negroes into the French Army.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_38_0	““The Rhinoceros and Mandril are, therefore, correct in giving to fear a great importance in human politics, but they are both wrong, I think, in the view which they take of what is happening with regard to the Bolsheviks. A study of human history reveals the fact that politically man is an animal which never learns from experience. He himself is accustomed to say that there is nothing new under the sun, or that plus ça change plus c’est la méme chose, or that history repeats itself. In this, at any rate, man shows some understanding of himself. You know that, with his extraordinary love of malignant cruelty, he has invented a small cage with a wheel in it, and that he is accustomed to confine in it one of the most beautiful and cheerful of all animals, the squirrel, and that, apparently, it gives him pleasure to see the squirrel go round and round without making any progress in any direction. The squirrel in the cage is the epitome of man’s history. He is always setting out with drums and trumpets in order to reach the place from which he started, and when he has devastated half the earth in order to get back to his starting place, he complacently remarks that there is no new thing under the sun and that history repeats itself.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_39_0	"""Both the Rhinoceros and the Mandril are wrong in believing that the Russians or Bolsheviks are a new species. They have existed for hundreds of years. They existed in France at the time of the French Revolution, and they performed the same antics there, one hundred and thirty years ago, as they have just been performing in Petrograd and Moscow. The revolutionary wheel goes round, and it makes not a pin’s difference whether Mirabeau and Danton and Robespierre are in it or Lenin and Trotsky and some fanatical Russian. And it is precisely the same with the reactionaries and conservatives ; the Tsar and Tsarina, the Allies and Denikin and Kolchak, Mr, Baldwin and the Conservatives have copied in every minute particular the antics of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette, of the Allies of 1791 and the Comte de Provence and the émigrés, of Mr. Pitt and the Conservatives of 1793."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_40_0	"‘“ In order to prove my point, I should have to read to you the eight volumes of Sorel’s History. I can now only give you one or two instances which will show you how the human species is revolving in its wheel. The people who made the French Revolution were pacifists and internationalists just like the Russians who made their revolution. In 1789 there was to be universal brotherhood and perpetual peace and “no annexations and no indemnities.’ At first all the ‘ Liberals ’ everywhere welcomed the revolution with tears in their eyes, just as they did in 1917. But then fear began. As soon as the revolutionaries in France touched ‘ legal rights ’ — of the King and the aristocracy and the clergy and, above all, of property — people began to grow afraid— ‘ it may be our turn next,’ they said. Emigration started at once; there were French Princes, Dukes, Counts, and gentlemen in every country of Europe, already talking of and plotting ""intervention.” ‘Then it was the turn of the revolutionaries to become afraid; they struck at the émigrés and their property or at all who might be suspected of wanting to emigrate. The King and Queen were afraid, and plotted with Austria and Prussia and Russia and the émigrés; the revolutionaries were afraid of the King and Queen, of Austria and Prussia and Russia and intervention ; they begana ‘reyolutionary propaganda’ outside France. Then the English became afraid of the propaganda; they"
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_40_1	demanded that the French Government should cease its propaganda which was directed against the institutions of other countries. Austria, Prussia, France, and England mobilized their armies or fleets, the the émigrés mobilized their corps of ‘ volunteers' on the frontiers; and when everyone was sufficiently afraid of everyone else, war. And when the Allies appeared to have been victorious and Fox demanded that peace should be made, 'Pitt declared' - M. Sorel — ‘that England could never negotiate with France as long as she claimed to impose the so-called principles of the Rights of Man, principles of conquest without and disturbance within. Moreover, negotiate with whom? Factions rise and fall one after the other; every post brings the tale of new crimes. If we were to negotiate with Marat, before the end of the negotiations he would have sunk again into the dregs of the people from which he rose and would have left in his place a more atrocious criminal than himself ?’
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_41_0	"""You will see that poor Mr. Baldwin, who believes that he believes in the Rights of Man, is as regards the Rights of the Proletariate precisely at the same point in the wheel where Mr. Pitt was revolving in 1793: Now let us turn to Mr. MacDonald...'"
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_42_0	But the elephant interrupted:
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_43_0	"""I do not wish to cut short this discussion, but the hour is late, the night is short, and history and history and M. Sorel appear to be long. I propose to wind up and sum up this debate. I am too old to be anything but impartial, So find me upon the side neither of the Rhinoceros and Mr. Baldwin nor of the Mandril and the Bolsheviks."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_44_0	"""One indisputable and important fact has been established by our discussion. Human beings live in mortal fear the one of the other. Everyone is terrified that his neighbour will cut his throat or shoot him in the back or blow him up with high explosive shells or drop a bomb on his head or destroy his lungs with poison gas or steal his wife or conquer a bit of his native land or a bit of land that he has conquered, or filch his watch or his money, or get better pay than he does, or climb over his head in society."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_45_0	"""It has been pointed out to-night that among human beings justice an and patriotism and wisdom and truth are only other names for fear. I agree, but I do not agree that fear is the beginning and end of political wisdom. I want to recall certain facts which some of us naturally have forgotten or have ignored."
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_46_0	“Some of us in these gardens have never been free. Two thousand years ago one of these human animals, I understand, wrote a poem which says: ‘ Of all things not to be born into the world is best, nor to see the beams of the keen sun; but being born, as swiftly as may be to pass the gates of Death, and lie under a great load of earth.’ And I say to you: 'Of all things never to have known freedom is best; but being born free, as swiftly as may. be to pass the gates of a Zoological Gardens, and to live behind strong bars and mighty locks.’
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_47_0	‘ Those happy animals among us who have never known what it was to be free, whose tickets upon their cages bear the fortunate inscription BORN IN CAPTIVITY, may not understand what I am going to say. I was born in the jungle. Do you remember the jungle ?”’
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_48_0	The Elephant trumpeted the words so that they boomed out over the cages and the Mappin Terraces, and a curious hush fell upon the animals. The Elephant trumpeted again : ‘“ Do you remember the jungle ?”’ and every animal felt the note of fear in the sound.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_49_0	‘‘ Some of you, I see,’’ he went on, ‘‘ remember the jungle, but for those of us who do not understand, I will explain. We were free in the jungle, and very pleasant it was on a fresh cool morning to shoulder your way through the undergrowth, the heavy dew dripping from the leaves, and to bring down the saplings with a crash and to feed on the young leaves. I remember the great herds of deer running free on the great plains; I remember how the monkeys laughed and chattered in the flowers, and how the peacocks on the tree. tops screamed their greetings to the rising sun.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_50_0	‘‘ Yes, it was sometimes very pleasant to be free in the jungle. But only for a moment, because the jungle was a place of perpetual fear. We were all, like these human animals, perpetually afraid of one another. It was a continual struggle, a continual killing of one by the other. The deer were perpetually fleeing from the leopard and the tiger and the leopard and the tiger from their own shadows. Fear ruled us and the beginning and the end of jungle wisdom was fear. We Elephants are old and wise and peaceful, but I can remember how some faint whisper of a little creaking or a faint scent coming from the shadows of the trees would strike a sudden fear into me and I would charge, panic stricken, away through the undergrowth in what, I have no doubt, the Rhinoceros would describe as a magnificent blind rush. It may have been wisdom, but it was not pleasure.
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_51_0	“It is clear from our discussion to-night that men are still living in the jungle. They should learn a lesson from us. Here we are in captivity, peaceful, happy; unafraid, civilized. Here each of us, locked up securely in his or her separate cage, neither harms nor is harmed by, neither fears nor is feared by, any other animal. Is it not clear that man will never be happy and civilized and unafraid until he has done for himself precisely what he has done for us? These human beings delude themselves that a League of Nations or Protection or armies and navies are going to give them security and civilization in their jungle. But they are the savagest race of carnivora known in the jungle, and they will never be happy and civilized, and the world will never be safe for democracy or for any other animal, until each human animal is confined in a separate cage.”
1-7-fear-politics-debate-zoo	doc_29_52_0	The Elephant then declared the meeting closed amid applause.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_0_0	INTRODUCTION
1-6-retreat	doc_30_1_0	It is now seven years since the incidents here related took place, and six years since I wrote down this account. I had preserved, rather by accident than by design, a bundle of messages and field-maps connected with the Retreat, and it occurred to me, in the Spring of 1919, that here was circumstantial evidence of a kind which, despite the immensity of the war, was little likely to be preserved. My memory of the events associated with these relics was yet vivid enough to give them a real connection, and this I set myself todo. One thing I wished to avoid, and that was any personal interpretation of the events—any expatiation, that is to say, whether of the imagination or of the intellect. I wanted the events to speak for themselves unaided by any art.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_2_0	I tried to publish this short narrative as soon as I had written it; and in this effort I received encouragement and advice from one whose name should have been sufficient to remove many obstacles. But the state of the public mind, or at least, of that mind as localised in the minds of publishers and editors, refused anything so bleak. The war was still a sentimental illusion: it was a subject for pathos, for platitude, even for rationalisation. It was not yet time for the simple facts.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_3_0	I then resolved to put the narrative away for five years and see what change came over the public mind, or my mind too, in that interval.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_4_0	Personally I find myself receding from the stern oath of realism I took when in the midst of war; receding, too, from whatever bitterness I then felt against the charlatans who proferred their vicarious interpretations of our experience. I still feel some bitterness that so little that is effectual should have been recorded of the reality ; and most bitter, perhaps, at certain states of forgetfulness in the minds of non-combatants. But I have nothing to say—no desire to say anything—on that aspect of the turn of events. I have grown to think that whatever is effected by the written word must be effected on the plane of imagination and thought.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_5_0	But these cannot subsist without logical roots in experience. And meanwhile there is historic truth—a necessary science; and this transcript of experience is designed to that end. It does not pretend to be more than a very small fragment of the history of the war; but 77 full that history will never be written.

1-6-retreat	doc_30_7_0	IN RETREAT
1-6-retreat	doc_30_8_0	A JOURNAL OF THE RETREAT OF THE FIFTH ARMY FROM ST. QUENTIN, MARCH 1918.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_9_0	. . . No, it is impossible ; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one’s existence—that which makes its truth, its meaning, its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dream—alone. . .
1-6-retreat	doc_30_10_0	Josep Conrad.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_11_0	We received the warning order just before dinner, and for awhile talked excitedly round the mess fire, some scoffing at the idea of an imminent battle, others gravely saying that this time at any rate the warning was justified. Two deserters, with tales of massing guns and the night-movement of innumerable troops, had reached our lines the previous day. Of course, deserters usually had some such tale designed to tempt a captor’s leniency, but this time it was likely to be the truth. What else could the enemy’s long silence mean? To that question we had no answer. We went early to bed, expecting an early awakening. ‘The harnessed horses stood in lowered shafts.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_12_0	There was scarcely a wall standing in Fluquières : everywhere demolition and bombardment had reduced the village to irregular cairns of brick and plaster. Winding among these cairns were the cleared roadways. Men and horses rested in patched sheds and an occasional cellar. S. and I were in a small repaired stable, each with a bed-frame in a manger. I had livened the cleanly whitewashed walls of the place with illustrations from a coloured magazine. That evening all save our trenchkit had been sent to the transport-waggons, and we were lying on the bare netting with only our trench coats thrown over us.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_13_0	For some time I was too excited to sleep, and none too warm. But weariness did at length triumph, and when, a short while afterwards, I was roughly awakened, I had become unconscious enough to forget the continuity of things.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_14_0	II
1-6-retreat	doc_30_15_0	Yes: suddenly I was awake. A match was being applied to the candle stuck on the bed-frame above my head. With his excited face illumined by the near candle-light, an orderly bent over me and shook my shoulders. I heard confused shoutings, and the rumble of gunfire. I had hardly need to read the message-form held out to me: “Man Battle Stations ”—the code words I knew only too well, and all that they implied. I was shivering violently with the cold, but in the shaking candle-light I scribbled messages repeating the code to the company commanders, the transport officer, and to others. S. was moving on the other side of the wall that divided the mangers.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_16_0	“ We're in for it, my lad,” he yelled, above the increasing din.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_17_0	Just then there was the sudden shrieking rush of a descending shell and its riotous detonation very near. Our candles jumped out, and we were in darkness, with bricks and earth falling like a hail on the roof. My servant came in, and hastily helped me to gather my equipment together. He handled the two or three books I always carried with me, asking me if I would take one in my pocket. I took Thoreau’s Walden, because I had not yet read it, and anticipated two or three weary days of passive defence. For even if now we realised the actuality of the enemy’s attack, so confident were we of our defensive system that we contemplated nothing more than a short successful resistance. When in the front line we had ceaselessly reconnoitred all approaches, and so fine were the sweeping fields of fire that stretched away towards St. Quentin, so skilfully placed were our machineguns, that always we pitied the folly of the enemy should he assail a defence so deadly. We reckoned with one factor unseen.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_18_0	I fixed my revolver and ammunition securely, and set out to the orderly room, some five hundred yards away. It was now about five o’clock and still dark. I picked my way along a path which led across the great heaps of rubble. Shells were falling in the village. I still shivered with cold. My electric torch was nearly exhausted, so that I kept falling as 1 went. When I reached the orderly room, which was in a restored cottage, I found everything in a great hubbub, orderlies coming and going, the sergeantmajor shouting orders. Inside the doctor was bandaging a wounded man.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_19_0	S., who had been assembling the headquarter staff, came to say that something terrible had happened to the Lewis team (at that time a Lewis-gun team was attached to each battalion headquarters): would I come round with my torch.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_20_0	They had been sleeping, some six men, beneath tarpaulin sheets, stretched across a half-demolished outhouse. A shell had fallen in the middle of them. In the weak glare of my torch, we saw a mangled mass of red brick-dust and of red glistening blood. Here and there we distinguished a tousled head of hair. One man, pinned beneath beams and brickwork, was still groaning. We quickly began to extricate him, but he died whilst we worked.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_21_0	I then joined the colonel, and with one or two orderlies and the sergeant-major we followed the companies along the back lane that led from Fluquiéres to Roupy, a distance of about a mile and a half. The morning was cold and a heavy dew lay on the ground. As we walked the light of dawn began to reveal a thick wet mist.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_22_0	III
1-6-retreat	doc_30_23_0	At 6.50 I sent a message to the brigade, informing them that the battalion was in position. We had been shelled all along the way, and when we neared Roupy, the crossroads seemed to be under a continuous barrage. Nevertheless, we got into position with very few casualties. Safe in the bowels of the headquarter dugout, we thought the worst was over, and began casually to eat the tonguesandwiches and drink the tea provided by the mess-corporal.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_24_0	The dugout was new and spacious, and odorous of the fresh chalky earth. It was about thirty feet deep, and partitioned into three sections, of which the middle one was occupied by the headquarter officers. Because it was new it was unfurnished, and we had to squat on the bare floor, grouped round a few candles.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_25_0	For me that cavern is a telephonic nightmare. The instrument, a “‘ D III converted,” was placed on the floor in a corner of the dugout. ‘Two signallers sat with their legs straddling round it. At first the companies, then the neighbouring battalions, and, finally, the brigade, kept me there crouching on the floor, yelling till I was hoarse into the execrable instrument. When I was not speaking, the signallers were receiving or sending Morse messages.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_26_0	Above the ground, the situation was disquieting. The thick mist of the early dawn persisted : a man ten yards away could not be distinguished. The gunfire, tremendous in its intensity, continued hour after hour to pound into the invisible foreground. The earth vibrated almost hysterically. An occasional shell crashed near us, but after the first three hours (at 7.30) the enemy’s fire seemed to be concentrated on our front-line defences. No messages, telephonic or written, came to relieve our anxiety.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_27_0	The gradual accumulation of our anxiety should be realised. Every minute seemed to add to its intensity. By ten o’clock or so, our hearts were like taut drum skins beaten reverberantly by every little incident.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_28_0	Then the skin smashed. Bodily action flickered like flame. The sense of duration was consumed away.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_29_0	Shortly after eleven o’clock, a gun team galloped madly down the main road. Then two stragglers belonging to the Machine-Gun Corps were brought to headquarters. They informed us that the front line had been penetrated. Later, an officer from the front-line battalion, with five or six men, came to us out of the mist. Most of the party were wounded, and as the officer’s leg was being bandaged in the dugout, he told us his tale. He was haggard and incoherent, but the sequence was awfully clear to us. The enemy had attacked in great strength at 7.30. They had apparently reached the observation line unobserved, and overpowered the few men there before a warning could be given or an escape made. Advancing under cover of a creeping barrage, they had approached the main line of defence. No fire met them there, or only fire directed vaguely into the fog. The fight at the main line had been short and bloody. Our men, dazed and quivering after three hours’ hellish bombardment (I could see them cowering on the cold mist-wet earth), had been brave to the limits of heroism; but pitifully powerless. The ghastly job had been completed by 8.30. About nine o’clock fresh enemy battalions passed through their fellows and advanced towards the front-line redoubt (L’Epine de Dallon). Our artillery fire must have been useless by then, still falling on the old enemy front line, At any rate, the enemy quickly surrounded the redoubt, and then penetrated it. This
1-6-retreat	doc_30_29_1	officer himself had been captured, and later had made his escape in the mist. He thought it possible that the headquarters of his battalion were still holding out.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_30_0	We were still questioning our informant when an excited voice yelled down the dugout shaft: ‘ Boches on the top of the dugout.” Our hearts thumped. There was no reason why the enemy shouldn’t be on us. They might have been anywhere in that damned mist. We drew our revolvers and rushed to the shaft. We did not mean to be caught like rats in a hole.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_31_0	I remember my emotion distinctly: a quiet despair. I knew I went up those stairs either to be shot or bayoneted, as I emerged, or, perhaps, to be made prisoner and so plunge into a strange unknown existence.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_32_0	Half-way up the stairs, and a voice cried down: “It’s all right: they’re our fellows.” Some artillerymen in overcoats, straggling across the open, had looked sinister in the mist.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_33_0	We turned to the dugout, the released tension leaving us exhausted.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_34_0	Patrols from our front companies had been feeling outward all morning, at first without result. At 12.30 B. (commanding the left front company) reported : “‘Machine-gun and rifle-fire on left and right can be heard. Shelling very hard. Can see nothing. Patrols are being sent out.” At 1 p.m. he reported: ‘ Boche are in quarry just in front of me. We are firing Lewis guns and rifles at him. He seems to be firing from our right flank too, with machine-guns,”
1-6-retreat	doc_30_35_0	These and other messages all came by runner, The telephonic communications to the companies had broken down before noon, though I think we remained in touch with the brigade until late in the afternoon.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_36_0	About midday the mist began to clear a little. At one o'clock the enemy, having massed in the valley five hundred yards immediately in front of us, attacked in ass strength. The fusillade that met them must have been terrific. They came on in good order, extending and manoeuvring with precision. At 1.20 B. reported ; _ “No. 5 Platoon report enemy on wire in front. Artillery ssistance is asked for. We are firing rifle grenades into em.” And again at 1.30: “Boche attacking in strength the sections in front. Front troops are in valley in front. They are also heading to my left flank.” Between 1.30 and 1.40 the attack reached its greatest intensity. By 1.45 it had withered completely before the hail of our fire.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_37_0	At 1.45 B. reported; “Boche running back like hell near Savy. They seem to be running from artillery as much as anything.” (Savy was one and a half miles to our left front: it was on the slope that rose away from the valley in front of us where the enemy had massed his forces
1-6-retreat	doc_30_38_0	For a Moment we became elated. There was cause enough. The mist had lifted, and a pale sun shone. We had defeated a strong attack. We received a message from the Inniskillings on our right to say they still held their positions intact. And wider afield the cO-ordination of the enemy’s advance seemed to have broken down. We made haste to distribute our reserve ammunition, to clear the dressing-station, and generally to make ourselves ready for the next happenings. In reply to my inquiries B. sent this Message, timed 2-15 p-m.: “It is very difficult to tell numbers of enemy, I can see the ground north to Savy, and saw them scattered. The line advancing had about 30 men 7 every 100 yards, We do not require §,A.A. yet. Can you instruct Rose! to fire up Soup Valley, please. We will want Very lights for the night. Will a supply be forthcoming ? Can see no movement now. Boche is putting up white lights all along valley.”
1-6-retreat	doc_30_39_0	IV
1-6-retreat	doc_30_40_0	The lull was not of long duration. Either we had been deceived by the movements near Savy, or the enemy had made a miraculously swift recovery. At 2.45 I received another message from B.: “Enemy movement at F. 12 at 4.0. They appear to be carrying in wounded. Enemy also advancing across valley on left on F. 5, in small parties. Estimated total strength seen, 50 men. Boche aeroplanes are flying about 300 feet above our lines, and have been for a short while past. There is still some machinegun fire in front. Is a redoubt holding out ?”
1-6-retreat	doc_30_41_0	The aeroplanes were evidently making a preliminary reconnaissance, and I guessed the movement to be significant of a new attack.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_42_0	On the mists clearing, the aeroplanes were able to sight position, and soon the artillery on both sides became active. Our own artillery, alas, fired short, smashing our already weakened defences. The Germans brought up their light field guns with great skill and rapidity. Several batteries were observed coming over the ridge at L’Epine de Dallon—only a few hours ago the headquarters of the battalion we were supporting. We now realised our position in earnest, and I sent a detailed account of the situation to the brigade.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_43_0	"Towards four o’clock, the enemy shelling increased in intensity. The second attack was now imminent. B sent the following message, timed 4.30 p.m. ""Boche is attacking on right about 400 strong, and is massing in the valley right in front of Roupy. We want some more S.A.A. During the Boche retreat the riflemen and Lewis guns did good work, killing many. Shelling very heavy."""
1-6-retreat	doc_30_44_0	The heavy shelling continued, and under cover of its intensity the enemy again massed in the valley in front of us. The men held on grimly. Thus B., timed §.10 p.m.: “Line holding still with some casualties. Reports not in. Line heavily shelled. §.A.A. received correct. Situation still the same. ‘Touch is being kept with battalion on our right, and patrols go constantly. (Our chloride of lime is missing and cannot be found.) Machine-guns very active.” And again at 5.40 p.m.: “The Boche is 50 yards or less from our line, and is also passing down the valley for another attack.”
1-6-retreat	doc_30_45_0	Then suddenly those massed men leapt from cover, and came on in their grey, regular formations. At headquarters we were only aware of the angry surge of rifle and machine-gun fire, deadening even the detonations of shells. All this time I was spending tiring, exasperating hours at the telephone, striving to get in communication with brigade and artillery headquarters. Again and again the wire was broken, and again and again the linesmen went out into the mist to mend it. ‘Then it got disconnected irreparably. We were isolated in that chaos.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_46_0	About 6.30 B. sent the following momentous message : “Boche got inside our wire on right and left. No.5 Platoon are all either wiped out or prisoners. No. 7 Platoon took up position on left of keep, but Boche were in it when I left. ‘They also were in trench on right of road left by C. Company, and we killed several on road near camouflage. I am now in redoubt with 25 men.”
1-6-retreat	doc_30_47_0	The climax had come. We had still one card to play— the counter-attack company. On receipt of B’s message, the colonel decided to order C. to attack in accordance with the preconceived plan.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_48_0	We only heard of this counter-attack from the mouths of a few survivors. It was one of the most heroic episodes in the retreat. ‘The company gathered together in the shell-battered trench that they had occupied all day, and then took the open. No artillery covered their advance, It was hopeless, insane, suicidal. ‘They had perhaps one hundred and fifty yards to cover. ‘They advanced at a jog-trot, lumbering on the uneven ground. One by one they fell before the fusillade that met them. C. had reached the enemy with about a dozen men. These leapt in among the Boches, and a hand-to-hand struggle ensued for a few minutes. C. was last seen cursing, pinned to the trench wall by a little mob of Germans, in one hand his empty smoking revolver.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_49_0	V
1-6-retreat	doc_30_50_0	It was now dusk, and with dusk came peace and silence. And at dusk this was our position :—The front rim of the redoubt was in the enemy’s possession. The counterattack company had disappeared. The company-keeps still held out with a few men in each. The inner ring of the redoubt was held by one company, and the remnants of three. B. had survived with one of his officers. But several officers in the three front companies had been either killed, wounded, or captured. There were probably two hundred men still surviving in the battalion.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_51_0	In the darkness the colonel and I walked up to the line. As we went along the road, the stillness was abruptly broken by the sounds of three or four shots, screams and curses. We flung ourselves on the roadside, our revolvers ready. We shouted: ‘‘Who goes there?” English voices answered, and the sergeant-major went to investigate. Two German privates had walked into a sentry on the road, coming from behind us. No one could understand what they said, and they were sent back to brigade headquarters. And I don’t remember that any one of us was perturbed by the incident, eerie though it was.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_52_0	Just after one o’clock in the day, we received long-awaited instructions from the brigade: The battalion in reserve was to deliver a counter-attack. The line of deployment was given, and the direction of attack. The battalion was to leave its position at 12.45, and the guns were to start a creeping barrage at 1.33 a.m.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_53_0	The whole thing was a ghastly failure. The night was black, and the battalion attacking was unfamiliar with the ground it had to cover. We waited hours for a sign of their approach. About two o’clock a stray officer came to us, having lost his company. Eventually, about four o’clock, one company did appear. It went forward in the darkness, but got dispersed and uncontrollable in the effort to deploy into attack formation. Dawn found us as dusk had found us, with the sole difference that some two hundred men of the counter-attack battalion had found refuge in our redoubt, and in the keeps in front.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_54_0	I think by then we were past hope or despair. We regarded all events with an indifference of weariness, knowing that with the dawn would come another attack. We distributed ammunition, reorganised our Lewis guns, and waited dully, without apprehension.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_55_0	Again the morning was thickly misty. Our own artillery fire was desultory and useless. Under cover of the mist, the enemy massed in battle formation, and the third attack commenced about 7 a.m. We only heard a babel in the mist. Now our artillery was firing short among our men in the redoubt. About ten o’clock the enemy penetrated our left flank, presumably in the gap between us and the battalion on our left, which was still in position. Machine-gun fire began to harass us from that direction, somewhere in the ruins of the village. We never heard from the battalion on our right, and a runner I sent there did not return. I think they must have withdrawn about ten o’clock.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_56_0	This new attack petered out. I fancy it was only half-hearted on the part of the enemy - probably only a demonstration to see if we intended to make a determined resistance, or to fight only a rearguard action. Finding the resistance determined enough, they evidently retired to prepare the real thing.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_57_0	This fourth attack was delivered about midday. The mist still persisted thinly. One could perhaps see objects fifty yards away. I don’t know what resistance the platoon-keeps offered. They were in a hopeless position, and would easily have been swamped in a mass attack.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_58_0	Shortly after midday, the enemy came in direct contact with the inner ring of the redoubt.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_59_0	We fired like maniacs. Every round of ammunition had been distributed. The Lewis guns jammed ; rifle bolts grew stiff and unworkable with the expansion of heat. In the lull before noon, the colonel and I had left the dugout, in which we were beginning to feel like rats in a trap, and had found an old gun-pit about two hundred yards further back, and here we established our An extraordinary thing happened. The gun-pit was dug out of the bank on the road-side. About two o'clock one of our guns, evidently assuming that Roupy had been evacuated, began to pound the road between Roupy and Fluquieres. One of these shells landed clean on the road edge of our pit. We were all hurled to the ground by the explosion, but, on recovering ourselves, found only one casualty: the colonel had received a nasty gash in the forearm. We then went two hundred to three hundred yards across the open, away from the road, and found a smaller overgrown pit. The colonel refused to regard his wound as serious ; but he soon began to feel dizzy, and was compelled to go back to the dressing-station. I was then left in charge of the battalion.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_60_0	It was now about 2.30. The attack still persisted in a guerilla fashion. But the enemy was massing troops in the trenches already taken. At 4 p.m. the intensity of the attack deepened suddenly. A new intention had come into the enemy’s mind : he was directing his attack on the flanks of our position in an effort to close round us like pincers. On the left he made use of cover offered by the ruined village, and eventually brought machineguns to bear against us from our left rear. On the tight he made use of the trenches evacuated by the Inniskillings.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_61_0	In the height of this attack, while my heart was heavy with anxiety, I received a message from the brigade. Surely reinforcements were coming to our aid? Or was I at length given permission to withdraw? Neither: it was a rhetorical appeal to hold on to the last man. I rather bitterly resolved to obey the command.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_62_0	Another hour passed. The enemy pressed on relentlessly with a determined, insidious energy, reckless of cost. Our position was now appallingly precarious. I therefore resolved to act independently, and do as perhaps I should have done hours earlier. I ordered B. to organise a witndrawal. ‘This message despatched, I lay on my belly in the grass and watched through my field-glasses every minute trickling of the enemy’s progress. Gradually they made way round the rim of the redoubt, bombing along the traverses. And now we only held it as lips might touch the rim of a saucer. I could see the heads of my men, very dense and in a little space. And on either side, incredibly active, gathered the grey helmets of the Boches. It was like a long bowstring along the horizon, and our diminished forces the arrow to be shot into a void. A great many hostile machine-guns had now been brought up, and the plain was sprayed with hissing bullets. ‘They impinged and spluttered about the little pit in which I crouched.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_63_0	I waited anxiously for B. to take the open. I saw men crawl out of the trenches, and lie flat on the parados, still firing at the enemy. Then, after a little while, the arrow was launched. I saw a piteous band of men rise from the ground, and run rapidly towards me. A great shout went up from the Germans: a cry of mingled triumph and horror. “Halt Eenglisch!” they cried, and for a moment were too amazed to fire; as though aghast at the folly of men who could plunge into such a storm of death. But the first silent gasp of horror expended, then broke the crackling storm. I don’t remember in the whole war an intenser taste of hell. My men came along spreading rapidly to a line of some two hundred yards length, but bunched here and there. On the left, by the main road, the enemy rushed out tocut them off. Bayonets clashed there. Along the line men were falling swiftly as the bullets hit them. Each second they fell, now one crumpling up, now two or three at once. I saw men stop to pick up their wounded mates, and as they carried them along, themselves get hit and fall with their inert burdens. Now they were near me, so I rushed out of my pit and ran with them to the line of trenches some three hundred yards behind.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_64_0	It seemed to take a long time to race across those few hundred yards. My heart beat nervously, and I felt infinitely weary. ‘The bullets hissed about me, and thought: then this is the moment of death: no no emotions. I remembered having reae men are hit, and never feel the hurt till later, and wondered if I had yet been hit. Then I reached the line. I stood petrified, enormously aghast. The trench had not been dug, and no reinforcements occupied it. It was as we had passed it on the morning of the 21st, the sods dug off the surface, leaving an immaculately patterned trench. A hundred yards on the right a machine-gun corps had taken up a position, and was already covering our retreat. I looked about me wildly, running along the line and signalling to the men to drop as they reached the slender parapet of sods. But the whole basis of my previous tactics had been destroyed. I should never have ordered my men to cross that plain of death, but for the expectation that we were falling back to reinforce a new line. We found an empty mockery, and I was in despair. But I must steady the line. On the actual plain the men obeyed my signals, and crouched in the shallow trench. But even as they crouched, the bullets struckthem. On the road, the straight white road leading to the western safety, there was something like a stampede. S. and the sergeant-major
1-6-retreat	doc_30_64_1	went and held it with pointed revolvers. But it was all useless—hopeless. On the right, I saw the enemy creeping round. They would soon enfilade us, and then our shallow defence would be a death-trap. I accordingly gave the signal to withdraw, bidding the two Lewis guns to cover us as long as possible. Once more we rose and scattered in retreat. It would be about seven hundred yards to the next trenches—the village line round Fluquiéres, and this we covered fairly well, sections occasionally halting to give covering fire. The enemy had not yet ventured from the redoubt, and our distance apart was now great enough to make his fire of little effect. And I think as we moved up the slope towards the village we must have been in “dead” ground, so far as the enemy advancing on the right was concerned.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_65_0	We reached Fluquiéres, which lay on the top of the slope, and found there some deep trenches on each side of the road at the entrance of the village. Further to the left, I found certain London troops commanded by a major. One of my Lewis guns still remained intact, and this I placed to fire down the straight road to Roupy. The enemy had now left the redoubt and were advancing in line formation.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_66_0	We were at Fluquières about an hour. ‘The enemy evidently did not intend to rest content with his capture of the redoubt. It was just beginning to get dusk. Earlier we had noticed sporadic contact lights go up. But now they shot into the sky from all along the plain. Low-flying aeroplanes hovered over the advancing line, and their wireless messages soon put the German guns on to us. Big black high-explosive shells began to fall on our position, making our tired flesh shudder. I now began to be amazed at the advancing contact lights. They did not merely stretch in a line im front of us: they encircled us like a horse-shoe, the points of which seemed (and actually were) miles behind us. On the right the enemy was enfilading us with machine-gun fire.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_67_0	I searched for the major commanding the troops on my left, but could not find him. By this time I was determined to act, and therefore gave the order to withdraw. The men filed through the village, gathering fresh ammunition from a dump at the cross-roads. From the village the road went up a slope leading to Aubigny. The enemy’s fire soon followed us, and we proceeded along the ditches on each side of the road.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_68_0	Three-quarters of the way up the slope I observed a trench running at right angles to the road on each side of it. I ordered the London men to go to the left, my own to the right, there to reorganise into companies. The twilight was now fairly deep, and I thought that with evening the enemy’s advance would stay. ‘The major I had seen in Fluquiéres now appeared again, and cursed me for giving the order to retire. I was too tired to argue, and even then a gust of machine-gun fire swept above our heads. They were going to attack again. We could hear them moving in the semi-darkness. Something else we could hear too—the throb of a motor-cycle behind us. It was a despatch rider, and when he drew level to us, he stopped his machine and came towards me with a message. I opened it. It ordered all troops east of the Aubigny defences to retire through Ham.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_69_0	I was glad. I believe I thought then that it was the end of our share in the battle. I went to the men, and assembled them in companies, and in close artillery formation we retired across country due west. We came to the Aubigny defences, manned by fresh troops, about a mile further on, and then we gathered on the road again and marched wearily along. I remember coming to a water-tank, where we all drank our fill — our mouths were swollen with thirst. When we reached Ham, an officer met us and ordered us to proceed to Muille Villette, about two miles further on, and there billet for the night. Ham, as we walked through its cobbled streets, seemed very hollow and deserted. ‘The last time we had seen it, it had been a busy market-town, full of civilians. Now only a few sinister looters went about the empty houses with candles. We saw one fellow come out of a door with a lady’s reticule and other things over his arm. We should have been justified in shooting him, but we were far too tired. We just noticed him stupidly.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_70_0	The road seemed long, and our pace was slow, but at last we reached the village of Muille Villette. We found it full of artillerymen and a few infantry. Every available shelter seemed to be occupied, but at length we got the men into a school. Our transport had been warned of our station for the night, and turned up with bullybeef and biscuits. These we served out.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_71_0	I had four officers left with me. We could not find a billet for ourselves, but finally begged for shelter in a barn occupied by artillerymen. They looked on us unsympathetically, not knowing our experiences. On a stove one of them was cooking a stew of potatoes and meat, and its savour made us lusting beasts. But the artillerymen ate the slop unconcernedly, while we lay down too utterly weary to sleep, languidly chewing bully-beef.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_72_0	VI
1-6-retreat	doc_30_73_0	It was after midnight when we came to Muille Villette ; I suppose about 2 a.m. we fell into an uneasy sleep. At 4 a.m. we were awakened by the stirrings and shoutings of the artillerymen. I drew my long boots on my aching feet, and went out into the cold darkness. I found an officer of some kind. The enemy were reported to have attacked and penetrated the Aubigny defences, and to be now advancing on Ham. All the troops stationed in Muille Villette had received orders to withdraw.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_74_0	We assembled the men, stupid with sleep. I knew that brigade headquarters were stationed at Golancourt, a mile and a half along the road. I resolved to proceed there and ask for orders. We marched away while the dawn was breaking.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_75_0	I found the brigade established in a deserted house. T., the brigade-major, was seated on a bed lacing his boots. No orders for the brigade had yet been received, so T. advised me to find billets for the men, where they could rest and get food. The companies then sought billets independently, and, what was more blessed than anything, we managed to get them hot tea. I went and had breakfast with the brigade staff. The tea revived me, and I remember how voracious I felt, and that I tried to hide this fact. The brigadier came into the room and seemed very pleased to see me: apparently he was very satisfied with our conduct, and especially with the frequent reports I had sent back. ‘Till then I had only felt weariness and bafflement — even shame. But now I began to see that we were implicated in something immense — something beyond personal feelings and efforts.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_76_0	The brigadier told me as much as he knew of the general situation. It was not much. The communications had apparently broken down, But it was enough to make me realise that more than a local attack was in progress: the whole of the Fifth Army was involved : but there were no limits to what might be happening.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_77_0	I also learnt that Dury — where the divisional headquarters had been stationed — a village some five or six miles south-west of Roupy, had been captured about two o’clock on the afternoon of the 22nd, several hours before we had evacuated the redoubt. Only a miracle of chance had saved us from being cut off.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_78_0	The brigade seemed to have difficulty in getting into touch with the division, or, at any rate, in obtaining orders from them. But at 10 a.m. I was told to march to Freniches and await orders there. We assembled in the village street and marched on again. The road was busy with retreating artillery and a few infantrymen. From behind us came the sounds of firing: the enemy were attacking Ham. We trudged on, passing villages whose inhabitants were only just taking steps to flee. They piled beds, chairs, and innumerable bolsters on little carts, some hand-pulled, some yoked to bony horses. They tied cows behind. There were old men, many old women, a few young women, but no young men. They and their like proceeded with us along the western road.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_79_0	We had gone perhaps five miles when an orderly on horseback overtook us with orders. We were to report to the —th Division at Freniches.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_80_0	This we eventually did, and a fat staff colonel studied a map, and then told me to take my battalion to Esmery-Hallon, a village four miles due north, and there take up a defensive position. This was more than I expected. I explained that my men had been fighting continuously for forty-eight hours, and were beaten and spiritless. But I received no comfort; the situation demanded that every available man should be used to the bitter end. I hardly dared to face my men: but I think they were too tired to mind where they went. We turned off at a right angle, and slowly marched on. The road led through a beautiful patch of country, steeped in a calm, liquid sunshine. We tilted our bodies forward, and forced our weary muscles to act.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_81_0	About two miles south of Esmery-Hallon, an officer (a lieutenant) appeared on a motor-cycle. He was in command of a scrap lot — transport men, cobblers, returned leave men, etc. He seemed to have the impression that the enemy were upon us, and wanted me to deploy and take up a position facing east. I explained that we were much too tired to do any such thing. He expostulated. Did I realise this, that, and the other? I explained that I had cause to realise such things better than he did. Heraved. I told him finally that I didn’t care a damn, but that I had orders to defend Esmery-Hallon, and thither I must go. He went off in a rage, seeming incredibly silly and fussy to us all.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_82_0	Esmery-Hallon is a small village perched on a detached conical hill, overlooking the plain on all sides. The defence was simply arranged. ‘Two companies of engineers were entrenched in front of the village. I sent a lookout on to the top of the church tower, and extended my men astraddle the hill on each side of the village, north and south. ‘The men on the south found a ditch, which made an admirable trench. The men on the north extended over the ploughed land, and dug shallow pits for shelter. We had no machine-guns or Lewis guns, but every man had a rifle and a decent amount of ammunition. I established my headquarters on the north side by a quarry, where I had a wide view of the plain.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_83_0	The day was very still, and the distant rattle of machinegun fire carried to us. A few enemy shells fell ineffectively about the landscape. I got into touch with a major of the Inniskillings in command of one hundred and fifty men on my right, and we co-ordinated defences on that wing. My left wing was in the air, so to speak — not a soul visible for miles.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_84_0	When our dispositions were finally made, I returned to the quarry edge. My servant T. had already been away to search the village, and now came laden with samples of red wine and cider which he had found in a cellar. So I sent him back to the village with other men, telling them to search for food also. They soon returned with bottles of red wine and a large tin of army biscuits. Evidently there was any amount of wine, but I was afraid to distribute it among the men for fear lest on fasting stomachs it should make them drunk. So S. and I each took a wine glass, and starting at different points, we began to go a round of the men. Each man lay curled up in his shallow pit, resting. To each we gave a glass of wine and a few biscuits. They took it thankfully. There was a lull in the distant fighting: I don’t remember any noise of fire during that hour. The sun was warm and seemed to cast a golden peace on the scene. A feeling of unity with the men about me suddenly suffused my mind.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_85_0	VII
1-6-retreat	doc_30_86_0	It was nearly two o’clock when we got settled. About this time I interrupted a message which gave me the useful information that the enemy had been seen in Ham at 10a.m. I guessed that the silence meant they were now consolidating along the Somme Canal. Later in the afternoon a cavalry patrol trotted up to our position. Officer, men, and horses all looked very debonair and well fed. ‘The officer was very condescending towards me, but made a message of the information I gave him, thought it would not be worth while venturing further on to the plain, so rode away back, harness jingling, the sun shining on well-polished accoutrements,
1-6-retreat	doc_30_87_0	"About five o’clock, I judged that we were to be left alone for the night, and made my plans accordingly. I sent the following message to B., who was in charge of the men on the right of the village: ""We hold on to our present positions unless otherwise ordered. When it is getting dark close your men in a little to form 7 or 8 pickets. From these pickets send standing patrols out about 150 yards, or to any good observation point within warning distance. Any show of resistance should drive off any enemy patrols. But as far as I can make out the Boche is still east of the canal. Should you be attacked by overwhelming numbers, withdraw fighting in a due westerly direction under your own arrangements. I should do the same in case of need. I suggest you come up to have a look at our position before dark.”"
1-6-retreat	doc_30_88_0	But just after dark, I received orders to relieve the Royal Engineers in front of the village. I regretted this order, but had to obey it. We now found ourselves in freshly dug trenches on the flat of the plain, our view to the left and right obstructed by woods.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_89_0	Included in the orders mentioned was a message to the effect that advance parties of the French would probably arrive that night, and the positions would be shown to them. ‘This message filled us with wild hope; we became almost jaunty.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_90_0	But the night was very cold and heavily wet with dew. We improved the trenches, and stamped about, flapping our arms in an effort tokeep warm. 4 sat with L., bravest and brightest of my runners, on a waterproof sheet beneath a tree in the centre of our position. We waited for the dawn: it was weird, phantasmagorical. Again the fateful mist. As it cleared a little, the woods near us hung faintly in the whiteness.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_91_0	At 8 a.m. we began to observe troops retreating in front of us. They came in little groups down the road, oF straggled singly over the landscape. The mist gradually lifted. We heard machine-gun fire fairly near, somewhere on the right. The stragglers informed us that the enemy had crossed the canal in the early dawn, and was advancing in considerable force. We waited patiently. At 9 a.m. the enemy came into touch with our fellows on the left, and here we rebutted him successfully. At 9.30 the troops on our right were reported to be withdrawing. About ten o’clock there happened one of those sudden episodes which would be almost comic with their ludicrous bouleversement were they not so tragic in their results. Seemingly straight from the misty sky itself, but in reality from our own guns, descended round after round of shrapnel bursting terrifically just above our heads, and spraying leaden showers upon us. Simultaneously, from the woods on our right, there burst a fierce volley of machine-gun fire, hissing and spluttering among us. We just turned and fled into the shelter of the village buildings. I shouted to my men to make for the position by the quarry. We scuttled through gardens and over walls. By the time we reached the quarry we had recovered our sang-froid. We extended and faced the enemy, who were advancing skilfully over the plain on our left. We on our part were a scrap lot composed of various units. We hastily
1-6-retreat	doc_30_91_1	reorganised into sections. Retreat was inevitable. Then followed a magnificent effort of discipline. A major took charge of the situation, and we began to retire with covering fire, section by section, in perfect alternation.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_92_0	We were now on a wide expanse of plain, sloping gently westward. We stretched over this—a thin line of men, perhaps a thousand yards long. We were approaching the Nesle-Noyon Canal. When within a few hundred yards of the canal, we closed inwards to cross a bridge (Ramecourt). At the other end of the bridge stood a staff officer, separating the men like sheep as they crossed, first a few to the left, then a few to the right. Here I got separated from the majority of my men, finding myself with only fifteen. We were told to proceed along the bank of the canal until we found an unoccupied space, and there dig in.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_93_0	As we crossed the bridge, we saw for the first time the sky-blue helmets of French troops peeping above a parapet. I think our eyes glistened with expectation of relief.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_94_0	We went perhaps half a mile along the bank of the canal and there I halted my attenuated company. The sun was now blazing hotly above our heads. We dropped to the ground, utterly exhausted. Presently some of the men began spontaneously to dig. R., the only officer left with me, also took a pick and joined the men. I began to feel ashamed just then, for I would willingly have died. I took a spade (there was a dump of such things just by us) and began to shovel the earth loosened by R. I seemed to be lifting utterly impossible burdens. My flesh seemed to move uneasily through iron bonds ; my leaden lids drooped smartingly upon my eyes.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_95_0	We dug about three feet deep, and then ceased, incapable of more. At the foot of the bank there was a small pool of water. The enemy was not now in sight, so we plunged our hot faces and hands into its weedy freshness, and took off our boots and socks, and bathed our aching feet.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_96_0	In the evening, about 5 p.m., a few skirmishing patrols appeared on the horizon. But our artillery was now active and fairly accurate, and machine-guns swept the plain. The patrols retired, without having advanced any distance. A large German aeroplane, with a red belly, floated persistently above our line. We fired hundreds of shots at it, but without effect. ‘T. my servant, nearly blew my head off in his efforts.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_97_0	We had gathered a lot of sun-scorched hemlock and bedded the bottom of our trenches, and when night came on we posted sentries and huddled down to the bedding. ‘The night was clear, and I gazed unblinkingly at the fierce stars above me, my aching flesh forbidding sleep. Later, I must have dozed in a wakeful stupor.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_98_0	VIII
1-6-retreat	doc_30_99_0	The next daybreak, that of the 25th, was less misty. Bread and bully-beef had come up during the night, and we fed to get warmth into our bodies. But the sun was soon up, and we began to feel almost cheerful once again. There was no immediate sign of the enemy, and I walked along to the bridge we had crossed the previous day to glean some information of our intentions ; but the only plan seemed to be the obvious one of holding on to our positions. I noticed some engineers were there, ready to blow up the bridge if need be.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_100_0	About 8 a.m. we saw little groups of enemy cavalry appear on the horizon. Through my glasses I could see them consulting maps, pointing, trotting fussily about. Our artillery was planting some kind of scattered barrage on the plain, and an occasional near shot made the horsemen scamper. We watched them rather amusedly till ten o’clock and then we saw signs of infantrymen. ‘They came from the direction of Esmery-Hallon, and at first seemed in fairly dense formation. But they extended as they cut the sky line, and we soon perceived them advancing in open order. As they got nearer, they began to organise short rushes, a section at a time.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_101_0	We were now well stocked with ammunition — there were piles of it laid about—and as soon as the advancing troops were within anything like range, we began to “pot” them. In fact, the whole thing became like a rifle-gallery entertainment at a fair. But still they came on. Now we could see them quite plainly — could see their legs working like dancing bears, and their great square packs bobbing up and down as they ran. Occasionally one dropped.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_102_0	Immediately in front of our trench, about eight hundred yards away, there was a little copse of perhaps fifty trees. This they reached about eleven o’clock and halted there. If only our flanks held out, I guessed they would never get further, for between the copse and our rifles and Lewis guns there was not a shred of cover ; and we were well entrenched, with a wide canal in front of us.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_103_0	Of course, the artillery was busy all the while: not methodically, but thickly enough to give the day the appearance of a conventional battle. But then the unexpected (really we had no cause longer to regard it as unexpected), the fatal thing happened. A battery of ours shortened its range, and got our position exactly “ taped.” The shells fell thick and fast, right into our backs. We were, remember, dug in on the top of a bank, perhaps fifteen feet high. All along this bank the shells plunged. Fifty yards away, a shell landed cleanly into a trench, and when the smoke cleared there remained nothing, absolutely nothing distinguishable, where a moment ago had been five or six men. We grovelled like frightened, cowed animals. Still the shells fell: and there was no means of stopping them. I glanced distractedly round; men on the right were running under cover of the bank away totheright. Other men on the left were retreating to the left. I resolved to get out of it. Immediately behind us, fifty yards away, was a large crescent-shaped mound, very steep, like a railway embankment, and perhaps sixty feet high. It occurred to me that from there we should command, and command as effectively as ever, the plain in front of us. I made my intention known, and at a given signal we leapt down the bank, and across the intervening fifty yards. We were evidently in sight, for a hail of machinegun bullets made dusty
1-6-retreat	doc_30_103_1	splutters all round us as we ran,
1-6-retreat	doc_30_104_0	But we reached the mound without a casualty, and climbed safely on toit. There I found a few men already in occupation, commanded by a colonel, under whose orders I then placed myself.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_105_0	The enemy’s artillery fire now increased in volume. I saw a cow hit in a field behind us, and fall funnily with four rigid legs poking up at the sky.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_106_0	At 3.30 we saw the French retiring on the right, about a thousand yards away. They were not running, but did not seem to be performing any methodic withdrawal. We then fell into one of those awful states of doubt and indecision. What was happening ? Whatshould wedo? There was angry, ominous rifle-fire on our immediate left. About 4 p.m. there was a burst of machine-gun fire on our immediate right. I noticed that the stray bullets were coming over our heads. This meant that the enemy were advancing from the right.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_107_0	I then saw English troops withdrawing about six hundred yards away on the right — evidently the troops that had been defending the bridge. I did not hear any explosion, and so far as I know the bridge remained intact.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_108_0	At 4.15 I saw the colonel suddenly leave with his men his position on my immediate left. Although I was within sight — within calling distance — he did not give me an order. I was now alone on the mound with my fifteen men.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_109_0	I did not wait long. I resolved to act on my own initiative once more. We had now moved off the maps I possessed and might as well be in an unknown wilderness. I resolved to proceed due west, taking the sun as a guide. We moved down the back slope of the mound, At the foot we found a stream or off-flow from the canal, about ten feet wide and apparently very deep. As we hesitated, looking for a convenient crossing, a machine-gun a few hundred yards away opened fire on us. There were a good few trees about which must have obstructed the firer’s view: the cut twigs, newly budded, fell into the water. We hesitated no longer: we plunged into the stream. The men had to toss their rifles across, many of which landed short and were lost. The sight of these frightened men plunging into the water effected one of those curious stirrings of the unconscious mind that call up some vivid scene of childhood: I saw distinctly the water-rats plunging at dusk into the mill-dam at Thorntonle-Dale, where I had lived as a boy of ten.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_110_0	The water sucked at my clothes as I met it, and filled my field-boots. They seemed weighted with lead now as 1 walked, and oozed for hours afterwards.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_111_0	We came out facing a wide plain, climbing gently westward. Machine-gun and rifle-fire still played about us. We could see a church steeple on the horizon due west, and I told the men to scatter and make for that steeple. Shrapnel was bursting in the sky, too high to be effective. Werana little way, but soon got too tired. A., a faithful orderly, had stayed with me, and soon we walked over the fields as friends might walk in England. We came across French machine-gunners, who looked at us curiously, but did not seem very perturbed.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_112_0	"We eventually came to the village on the horizon (probably Solente). An officer of the engineers stood by the side of his horse at the cross-roads, smoking a cigarette. He asked me why I was retreating. The question seemed silly: ""We shall have to fight every inch of the way back again,"" he said. ""These Frenchmen will never hold them."" I went on, too tired to answer."
1-6-retreat	doc_30_113_0	"Here I saw for the first time a new post stuck on the roadside. It had on it an arrow and ""Stragglers Post"" in bold letters. So I was a straggler. I felt very bitter and full of despair."
1-6-retreat	doc_30_114_0	I followed the road indicated by the arrow. It was dotted with small parties of men, all dejected and weary. We trudged along till we came to the village of Carrepuits. Military police met us at the entrance, and told us to report to the Traffic Control in a house a few hundred yards away. It was now getting dusk. I went into the cottage indicated, and here found an officer, very harassed and bored. Men were collected, and separated into the divisions they belonged to, and then given orders to report to such and such a place. I found a party of about fifty men of my division, and was instructed to take them and report to a divisional headquarters situated in a certain street in Roye.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_115_0	I’ve forgotten that walk : it was only about two miles, but our utter dejection induced a kind of unconsciousness in us. It would be between ten and eleven o’clock when we got to Roye. I reported to a staff officer, who sent me off to the town major to get billets. The town major I found distracted, unable to say where I should find a billet. Apparently the town was packed with stragglers. We peered into two great gloomy marquees, floored densely with recumbent men. Meanwhile two other officers joined me with their men, and together we went off to search on our own. We found a magnificent house, quite empty, and here we lodged the men. Some kind of rations had been found. They soon had blazing wood fires going, and seemed happy in a way.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_116_0	The town major had indicated a hut, where we officers might get rest, and perhaps some food. We went round, tired and aching though we were; we lifted the latch and found ourselves in a glowing room. A stove roared in one corner—and my teeth were chattering with cold, my clothes still being sodden—and a lamp hung from the roof. A large pan of coffee simmered on the stove, and the table was laden with bread, tinned foods, butter; food, food, food. I hadn’t had a bite since early morning, and then not much.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_117_0	I forget, if I ever knew, who or what the two occupants were, but they were not stragglers. Roye had been their station for some time. One of them was fat, very fat with a tight, glossy skin. I don’t remember the other. We explained that we would like a billet for the night— anything would do so long as it was warmth. ‘They were sorry: they had no room. Could they spare us some rations? They were sorry: this was all they had got till to-morrow noon. We stood very dejected, sick at our reception. ‘‘ Come away!” I said. “ Before I go away,” cried one of my companions, with a bitter voice, “ I would just like to tell these blighters what I think of them.” Then followed a desperate man’s invective. . . . We walked away, back to the men’s billet. I looked in at my fellows; most of them were naked, drying their clothes at the fire. Some slept on the floor.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_118_0	We went upstairs into an empty room. Two of us agreed to make a fire, while the other, the one who had given vent to his feelings, volunteered to go off in search of food. We split up wood we found in the house, and lit a fire. I took off my clothes to dry them, and sat on a bench in my shirt. If I had been asked then what I most desired, besides sleep, I think I would have said : French bread, butter, honey, and hot milky coffee.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_119_0	The forager soon turned up. God only knows where he got that food from: we did not ask him. But it was French bread, butter, honey, and hot milky coffee in a champagne bottle! We cried out with wonder : believe we wept. We shared the precious stuff out, eating and june with inexpressible zest.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_120_0	As we supped we related our experiences. I forget their names; I don’t think I ever knew them. they of the Border Regiment ? I’m not sure; but they were Northerners. They had been trapped in a sunken road, with a Boche machine-gun at either end, and Boche calling on them to surrender. I don’t think either of them was more than twenty years old: they were fresh and boyish, and had been faced with this dilemma. They put it to the vote: there, with death literally staring them in the face, they solemnly called on the men to show hands as to whether they would surrender or make a run for it. They had voted unanimously for the run. Half of them perished in the attempt. But here, a few hours afterwards, were the survivors, chatting over a blazing wood fire, passing a bottle of coffee round, very unperturbed, not in any way self-conscious. We stacked the fire high and stretched ourselves on the floor in front of it, and slept for a few hours.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_121_0	IX
1-6-retreat	doc_30_122_0	We were up at six the next morning, the 26th of March, and reporting to the A.P.M., who was reorganising stragglers. We congregated in the Town Square, and I was amazed at the numbers there. The streets were thickly congested with infantrymen from several divisions, with French armoured cars, cavalry, and staff officers. We fell in by divisions, and presently marched off, a column a mile or two in length. Cavalry protected our flanks and rear from surprise.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_123_0	At Villers-les-Roye I found B., the man who had been separated from me at Ramecourt Bridge. We were glad to be united again, and from there proceeded together. B. had had orders to go to a place called La Neuville, where the first-line transport awaited us. We were now passing through the battlefields of 1916, and everywhere was desolate and ruined. We marched on as far as Hangest-en-Santerre, where we met our battalion cookers loaded with a welcome meal. Just as we had devoured this, and were starting on our way again, we were met by a staff colonel, who, after inquiring who we were, ordered us to turn back and proceed to Folies, where our brigade was reorganising.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_124_0	We could but mutely obey, but with dull despair and an aching bitterness. We had never thought since leaving Roye but that we were finally out of the mélée. To turn back meant, we knew, that we might still be very much in it. We crossed country to Folies, about two miles away, in a blazing sun. ‘There we found the details of the brigade, consisting mostly of returned leave men, already holding a line of trenches. We were told to reinforce them.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_125_0	Here the second-in-command rejoined the battalion and assumed command. My endurance was broken, and I was ordered down to the transport lines. I pointed out that the men were as weary as I, and had no right to be ordered into action again. It was useless : no man could be spared. But there was not much more for them to bear. Good hot food came up to them again at dusk. The night was warm and restful.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_126_0	On the morning of the 27th, the enemy had possession of Bouchoir, a village about one mile to the south-east. He commenced to advance during the morning, and a skirmishing fight went on during that day and the next ; and during this time the battalion was withdrawn from the line without suffering any serious casualties.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_127_0	X
1-6-retreat	doc_30_128_0	But I had gone back with the transport officer on the 26th. I mounted the transport-sergeant’s horse, and in a dazed sort of way galloped westward in the dusk. arrived half-dead at La Neuville, and slept there for twelve hours or more. The next day we went to Braches, and thence on foot to Rouvrel. About here, the country was yet unscathed by war, and very beautiful. On a bank by the roadside, I took Walden out of my pocket, where it had been forgotten since the morning of the 21st, and there began to read it. At Rouvrel the rest of the battalion rejoined us the next day. On the 29th I set off on horseback with the transport to trek down the valley of the Somme.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_129_0	When evening came and the hills of Moreuil were faint in the twilight, we were still travelling along the western road. No guns nor any clamour of war could be heard : a great silence filled the cup of misty hills. My weary horse drooped her head as she ambled along, and I, too, was sorrowful. To our north-east lay the squat towers of Amiens, a city in whose defence we had endured hardships until flesh had been defeated, and the brave heart broken. My mind held a vague wonder for her fate—a wonder devoid of hope. I could not believe in the avail of any effort. Then I listened to the rumbling cart, and the quiet voices of the men about me. ‘The first stars were out when we reached Guignemicourt, and there we billeted for the night. In this manner we marched by easy stages down the valley of the Somme, halting finally at Salenelle, a village near Valery, and there we rested four days.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_130_0	APPENDIX
1-6-retreat	doc_30_131_0	A. The scheme, common to the Fifth Army, was a defence by distribution in depth. The original front line was reduced to a line of observation posts, from 100 to 500 yards apart, each consisting of a section of men. These men were not intended to resist: they were to observe and give warning to the main line of defence about 200 to 500 yards behind them. This main line was well dug and well wired. But the battalion fronts were extremely long — as long as 2000 yards — and three companies, perhaps each 100 to 120 strong, became very attenuated along this distance, especially when you had deducted the men on the observation posts. But the line was exceedingly well sited, and, under ordinary circumstances, the machine and Lewis guns, helped by what rifle-fire there was, would have been adequate to cope with any attacking force.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_132_0	B. Behind the main line of resistance came the battalion redoubt. This was a circular defensive system, perhaps 800 yards in diameter, manned by the company in battalion reserve, battalion headquarters, and a Machine-Gun Corps unit. The construction of these redoubts was not yet completed, especially in the matter of wiring, and I remember how the colonel used to go round raging about the folly of the man who left his back door undefended.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_133_0	There was one of these redoubts to each battalion, so that between each redoubt there was a gap of some 1000 yards. These gaps were covered by machine-guns, and elaborate barrages were worked out by the artillery to cover the approaches to them.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_134_0	C. At varying distances behind the front-line system came a second line of redoubts occupied by the brigade in support. These were carefully sited and more or less echeloned with the redoubts 1000 to 3000 yards in front. It was one of these redoubts that we occupied at Roupy, and a detailed description of the defence is given in paragraph F,
1-6-retreat	doc_30_135_0	D. Behind this system of redoubts, resting in near villages and camps, came the brigade in reserve, They could be utilised to reinforce or counter-attack any part of the division’s frontage.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_136_0	E, A line of continuous trenches was in preparation behind the redoubt system, but on our frontage, on the 21st of March, this had only been outlined by removing the sods, and by the construction of one or two machine-gun emplacements. We had only a vague idea of what troops were in Army Reserve, and subsequent experience proved these to be negligible.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_137_0	F. The defences we occupied on the morning of the 21st were distributed as follows: the headquarters were in Stanley Redoubt : round this core was the wired ring of the redoubt, occupied on its eastern side by one company. Towards the enemy in front of the redoubt a short line was occupied by another company detailed to counter-attack should the line in front be broken. This front line was a crescent-shaped irregular line about 1000 yards long, occupied by two companies. The headquarters of each of these companies was about 200 yards behind the front line in a small keep, wired and defended by a small companyreserve. Communication trenches connected the front-line companies with the counter-attack company, and the counterattack company with the redoubt. The front-line companies were not well connected with the corresponding companies of the battalion on their flanks. There were gaps which could only be covered by visiting patrols.
1-6-retreat	doc_30_138_0	The system was, according to British standard, fairly well wired, and the redoubt was well stored with S.A.A. and reserve water and rations.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_0_0	POETRY AND CRITICISM
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_1_0	Abraham Cowley, in his Preface to Poems, 1656, says : “If wit be such a plant that it scarce receives heat enough to preserve it alive even in the summer of our cold climate, how can it choose but wither in a long and a sharp winter? A warlike, various, and a tragical age is best to write of, but worst to write in.” Whether this age, the most warlike, various, and tragical that our country has ever known, will flower into the virtues of future poets, I know not; but this I do know—that it has produced a sparse few great poets, and that it is a time of budding, like an early and cold spring. And, too, it is a time of turmoil and strife in the minds of poets—one of those ages which recurs, once every hundred years or so, when the poets must examine the claims of tradition, as far as the technique of poetry is concerned. For in every age of civilised times, or at any rate since the time of Shakespeare, we find poets discussing these problems of poetry and defending innovations in various Prefaces and Defences of Poetry. For instance, we know that Thomas Lodge published a Defence of Poetry in 1579, and Sir Philip Sidney an Apology for Poetry about the year 1583; Ben Jonson treated of the problems of poetry in his Discoveries, and Thomas Campion wrote his Observations on the Art of English Poesy in 1602. A little later, Sir
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_1_1	William Davenant’s theories, in his Preface to Gondibert, roused an answer from Thomas Hobbes. In this essay, Hobbes, irritated by the nonsense that is sometimes talked about inspiration, gibes at “ the foolish custom by which a man, enabled to speak wisely from the principles of nature and his own meditation, loves rather to be thought to speak by inspiration, like a bagpipe.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_2_0	It is still more amusing, for poets on whom Mr Je Squire tries to impose his “ dry ” regime, to read Samuel Daniel’s Defence of Rhyme, written in contradiction of Campion’s theories, for it contains passages which really might have been written by Mr Squire himself—sentences suchas this: “‘ Suffer . . . the world to enjoy that which it likes, and what it knows, seeing that whatsoever force of words doth move, delight, and sway the affections of men, in what Scythian sort soever it be disposed or uttered, that is true number, measure, eloquence, and the perfection of speech; which I said had as many shapes as there be tongues or nations in the world, nor can with all the tyrannical rules of idle rhetoric be governed otherwise than custom and present observation will allow.” It is easy to deduce from this that criticism has not changed—excepting in becoming more vulgar. For at least, in the centuries of which we speak, poetry was regarded as an art, and not as a vehicle for conveying misty moral ideas; it was not confounded with inferior metaphysics in the minds of the people, nor was it allowed that poetry should be the flimsy, unshaped outpourings of an emotion which would shame men in real life, or if it were represented upon a canvas. In those halcyon days criticism was regarded as the prerogative of the poet and the man of letters; it was for them to prove what poetry should
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_2_1	be and how it should be written, and even when these men of letters shrank from progress, at least they had some lucid and informed (even though misguided) reason for doing so. It was not until the times of Pope and Dryden that the real trouble began ; but even then matters were not so intolerable as they are at present, when the illiterate writers of musical comedies, revues, and salacious plays, and, with them, the writers of the Yellow Press, believe themselves to be competent to act as critics of literature. In a paper of the Yellow Press, a short while ago, an article appeared claiming that the English people have always been notable for “seeing through ” and exposing charlatans and impostors in literature and the arts. This is very true, since they have, in their time, seen through and rendered life intolerable to such charlatans and impostors as Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, and Wordsworth, and, before he was frightened into conforming to their ideals, Tennyson.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_3_0	Let us examine how these great poets of the past were treated. De Quincey, in the first edition of The Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, quotes a passage from Wordsworth, but does not name the author, saying merely that they are lines from “a great modern poet.” Then, in a later edition of the Confessions, De Quincey adds this note: “From a great modern poet... . What poet? It was Wordsworth; and why did I not formally name him? This throws a light backwards upon the strange history of Wordsworth’s reputation. The year in which I wrote and published these Confesstons was 1821; and at that time the name of Wordsworth, though beginning to emerge from the dark cloud of scorn and contumely which had hitherto overshadowed it, was yet most imperfectly established. Not until ten years later was his greatness cheerfully and generally acknowledged. I therefore, as the very earliest (without one exception) of all who came forward, in the beginning of his career, to honour and welcome him, shrank with disgust from making any sentence of mine the occasion for an explosion of vulgar malice against him. But the grandeur of the passage here cited inevitably spoke for itself, and he that would have been most scornful on hearing the name of the poet coupled with the epithet of ‘ great,’ could not but find his malice intercepted and himself cheated into cordial admiration by the splendour of the verses.”’
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_4_0	From this passage we understand that Wordsworth, who was born in 1770, was abominated and insulted until 1821, when he was fifty-one years of age, and barely tolerated for another ten years, until he was sixty-one, He was then, I presume, allowed to live in peace for the remaining nineteen years of his life. Let us transfer ourselves in imagination to 1821, the year when The Confessions of an English Optum-Eater saw the light. Mr Harold Monro reminds us, in the Chapbook of 1923, that “ Hyperion was published in 1820, Prometheus Unbound in 1821. The genius of Wordsworth was in hot dispute.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_5_0	“In 1817, however, Moore had been paid three thousand guineas for Lalla Rookh. Critical literature had recently been enriched by such works as Biographia Literaria, and Wordsworth’s unparalleled essays and prefaces... . But the Mr Squire . . . and Mr Lynd of that moment found mediocrity no less comfortably attractive, and while they were ardently agreeing to differ or agreeing to agree about Moore, Campbell, Kirke White, Bloomfield, Hogg, Southey, and others, many of the works that were destined later to represent the genius of the time unconsciously eluded them or were consciously dismissed.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_6_0	It is, indeed, interesting to examine Campbell’s enormous anthology of poetry. Campbell was, at least, a contemporary of Wordsworth and Coleridge, though he was fifteen years older than Shelley. Yet in this anthology the bulk of the poems are the dead, neat, flat, comfortable, safe works of William Shenstone and poets of the like kind. ‘The abuse to which the great poets of this time were subjected was only equalled by the neglect. Here are some of the criticisms they were obliged to bear.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_7_0	“The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” said the Monthly Review, “seems a rhapsody of unintelligible wildness and incoherence, of which we do not perceive the drift, unless the joke lies in depriving the guest of his share of the feast.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_8_0	“At first,” said the Quarterly, “it appeared to us that Mr Keats had been amusing himself and wearying his readers with an immeasurable game of bouts-rimés; but, if we recollect right, it is an indispensable condition of this play that the rhymes, when filled up, shall have a meaning ; and our author, as we have already hinted, has no meaning.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_9_0	Now take Jeffrey, of the Edinburgh Review. “The volume before us (Wordsworth’s The Excursion), if we were to describe it very shortly, we should characterise as a tissue of moral and devotional ravings, in which innumerable changes are hung upon a few very simple and familiar ideas ; but with such an accompaniment of long words, long sentences, and unwieldy phrases — such a hubbub of strained raptures and fantastical sublimities — that it is often extremely difficult for the most skilful and attentive student to obtain a glimpse of the author’s meaning, and altogether impossible for an ordinary reader to conjecture what he is about.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_10_0	Blackwood says of Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound: “'To our apprehension it is little else but absolute raving ; and, were we not assured to the contrary, we should take it for granted that the author is lunatic, as his principles are ludicrously wicked, and his poetry a mélange of nonsense, cockneyism, poverty, and pedantry.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_11_0	The Monthly Magazine says of Keats’ poems: “ The faults characteristic of his school are still held up with as much affectation by Mr Keats as if he were fearful of not coming in for his due share of singularity, obscurity, and conceit.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_12_0	But one of the hardest thrashings poets received at this time was from Thomas Peacock in his The Four Ages of Poetry. Here is a passage from this amusing, though disgracefully misguided, essay: “Thomson and Cowper looked at the trees and hills which so many ingenious gentlemen had rhymed about so long without looking at them at all, and the effect of the operation upon poetry was like the discovery of a new world, Painting showed the influence, and the principles of picturesque beauty were explored by adventurous essayists with indefatigable pertinacity. The success which attended these experiments, and the pleasure which resulted from them had the usual effect of all new enthusiasms — that of turning the heads of a few unfortunate persons, the patriarchs of the age of brass, who, mistaking the prominent novelty for the all-important totality, seem to have ratiocinated much in the following manner : ‘ Poetical genius is the finest of all things, and we feel we have more of it than anybody ever had. The way to bring it to perfection is to cultivate poetical impressions exclusively. Poetical impressions can be received only among natural scenes ; for all that is artificial is anti-poetical. Society is artificial, therefore we will live out of society. The mountains are natural, therefore we will live in the mountains. ‘There we shall be shining models of purity and virtue, passing the whole day in the innocent and amiable occupations of going up and down hill, receiving poetical
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_12_1	impressions, and communicating them in immortal verse to admiring generations.’ To some such perversion of intellect we owe that egregious confraternity of rhymesters, known by the name of the Lake Poets, who certainly did receive and communicate to the world some of the most extraordinary poetical impressions that were ever heard of, and ripened into models of public virtue too splendid to need illustration... This gave a new tone to poetry and conjured up a hetd of desperate imitators, who have brought the age of brass prematurely to its dotage.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_13_0	Forty-four years later we find Alfred Lord Tennyson, or, as he was at that time, Alfred Tennyson, Esq., P.L., D.C.L., in trouble. And what was he in trouble about ? He was in trouble about the disgraceful character of his poem Enoch Arden. We find the Englishwoman’s Magazine of 1864 standing up for him with the utmost courage as follows :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_14_0	“ Some of our contemporaries have worked themselves up into a very silly passion about Tennyson telling a story which turns upon ‘ bigamy ’ as the foundation of a work of art. But this is simply calling names... Now what is the essence of the thing called bigamy ? We beg pardon for reproducing such a coarse word, but no choice is left to us by the critics who have chosen to attack Mr Tennyson upon the ‘ morality’ of his poem. What, we ask, is the essence of the crime in question? .. . And what will readers who have been accustomed to trust reviews, especially respectable ones, what will they say when we inform them that Annie Lee does nothing of the kind? The poem states in the most explicit manner that the wife has been twelve years without hearing of her husband. This alone absolves her, according to the well-known unrepealed statute of George IV. But what is more, the poor woman must be held to be morally, as well as legally, absolved, for she takes pains to obtain guidance from Heaven, if possible—superstitious pains, but the best that occurred to her. She had recourse to what is known as sortilege; her Bible opened twice at a particular text... .”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_15_0	All this is most interesting, both as throwing a light upon the critics and as throwing a light upon Lord Tennyson.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_16_0	There is not the slightest difference between the criticisms of the past and the criticisms of to-day, excepting that the latter are more vulgar, and often more personally abusive. I do not, naturally, refer to those critics, men and women of profound and delicate insight, intelligence, and knowledge, to whom I, and all other poets, owe so much, but rather to those persons who, with no knowledge of poetry, wish to insult Personally the poets whose work they cannot understand. But the critics are not always unkind.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_17_0	Here is a criticism from the Sunday Times of 17th of 1926, showing exactly the same friendliness towards tame, safe verse that has always prevailed in England,
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_18_0	“The poet’s (Mr Edward Shanks’) work has lost none of its sweetness and artistry; it is, as always, quietly ascetic and lucid. Mr Shanks never startles,” (The italics are mine.) “ He plays a game that children tracing a shadow on the wall :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_19_0	“Until at last the lamp is brought, The game is done, and now I see The tangled scribble I have wrought Grimacing at me mockingly.’
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_20_0	But the revelation is, after all, an unexpected one, and not such as to disturb the most mobile placidity. A peculiar quality of certain types of the English countryside is made manifest in Mr Shanks’ descriptive verse ;
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_21_0	“But never a footstep comes to trouble The rooks among the new-sown corn, Or pigeons rising from the stubble, And flashing brighter as they roam, ”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_22_0	In savage criticisms (as also in this), the true function of the critic is set aside. Ben Jonson in his Discoveries says: “'The office of a true critic or censor is not to throw by a letter anywhere, or damn an innocent syllable, but lay the words together and amend them; judge sincerely of the author and his matter, which is the sign of solid and perfect learning ina man. Such was Horace, an author of much civility . . . an excellent and true judge upon cause and reason, not because he thought sO, but because he knew so out of use and experience.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_23_0	I think it cannot be denied that one of the principal reasons why certain critics, and a large part of the public, feel unable to understand the aims of modernist poets, is that these poets are leaving the tradition that leads from Wordsworth, and are returning to an earlier line in poetry. With the advent of Wordsworth the tradition of English poetry was changed, and it is understandable, therefore, that those people who, while they never read poetry, are so well fitted to judge of it, cannot see the tradition in modernist poetry, since they are only conversant with the line of poetry we have inherited from Wordsworth, and with that other tradition formed by the pre-Raphaelite poets, though this could scarcely be called a new line, since, before it, we had Keats. Many of the poets labelled Georgian are still writing in the manner and from the same point of view as that which has prevailed since Wordsworth, and therefore seem less obscure and alarming to a certain portion of the press and of the public.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_24_0	Every hundred years or so it becomes necessary for a change to take place in the body of poetry, otherwise the health and the force that should invigorate it fade. Then a fresh movement appears and produces a few great men, and once more the force and the vigour die from the results of age; the movement is carried on by weak and worthless imitators, and a change becomes necessary again. Because fresh life and vigour, and therefore change, become necessary to poetry, it does not mean that the old poets are less reverenced by the new. This change enriches the blood; it does not destroy the old, but it creates the new. With Wordsworth a fresh channel was brought into English poetry, for he insisted upon the right of a poet to bring the language of ordinary speech, the actions of common life, into poetry. In the Preface to Lyrical Ballads (1800—5) we find him urging this claim with passion and beauty: ‘‘ Poetry sheds no tears ‘such as angels weep,’ but natural and human tears ; she can boast of no celestial ichor that distinguishes her vital Juices from those of prose ; the same human blood circulates through them both.” Then in a note he writes: “I here use the word ‘ Poetry’ (though against my own judgment) as opposed to the word Prose, and synonymous with metrical composition. But much confusion has been introduced by this contradistinction of poetry and prose, snstead of the more philosophical
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_24_1	one of poetry and matter of fact or science. ‘The only strict antithesis to prose is metre. Nor is this, in truth, a strict antithesis, because lines and passages of metre so naturally occur in writing prose, that it would be scarcely possible to avoid them, even if it were desirable.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_25_0	Wordsworth battled for these principles and the cause of liberty during the whole of his life ; but, unfortunately, that liberty has by now been carried too far in some cases, and his argument that poetry is not an antithesis to prose has now been used as an excuse for the most monstrous excesses of dullness. It is therefore time that we returned to an earlier tradition in poetry, and left the peasant and words suitable to the peasant. Let us for a moment examine the new poetry to which so many people take exception, and we shall find in much of it the great tradition leading from the Elizabethans. ‘This couplet is not from an early seventeenth-century poem, yet it might well have been :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_26_0	‘ Leave the spangled waters and lie down to sleep Beneath these boughs that never cease to weep.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_27_0	I will not say the name of the poet who wrote those lines, for the same reason that prevented De Quincey from divulging the name of the poet whose verses he quoted.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_28_0	Again, free verse is by many people supposed to be a yehicle for conveying the sense, sound, and delight of slaughter-houses and factories, and it is supposed also to be a formless affair. But let us take other lines from the poem quoted above—these lines, for instance :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_29_0	"""Such are the clouds, They float with white coolness and snowy shade, Sometimes preening their flightless feathers, Float, proud swans, on the calm lake And wave your clipped wings in the azure air, Then arch your neck and look into the deep for pearls, Now can you drink dew from tall trees and sloping fields of heaven, Gather new coolness for to-morrow’s heat, And sleep through the soft night with folded wing.’"
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_30_0	It is extraordinary that anyone reading this should not realise the quality of the poetry. This is partly due, of course, to the fact that there is a general lack of interest in the fabric of poetry. Many people have no feeling for or knowledge of that quality which my friend Mr Robert Graves calls “texture.” ‘The term texture,” says Mr Graves in his invaluable Contemporary Techniques of Poetry, “ covers the relations of a poem’s vowels and consonants, other than rhymes, considered as mere sound, and supplementing the rhythm and images. It will... include the variation of internal vowelsounds to give an effect of richness; the use, perhaps, of liquid consonants and labials and open vowels to give smoothness, of aspirate and dentals to give force, of gutturals to give strength; the careful use of sibilants, which are to texture what salt is to food.” It is because of this insensitiveness to texture that most people do not realise that Alexander Pope’s The Rape of the Lock is one of the most beautiful, as it is one of the most skilful, poems in the English language. The texture of this poem is so airy that it might have been spun by one of the Sylphs of whom it speaks. But this airy quality is as much a matter of texture as of inspiration, as much a question of inspiration as of texture. Indeed, if the time ever comes when this poem is valued at its true worth, I shall
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_30_1	feel more hopeful for the future of English poetry. And for this reason The Rape of the Lock is one of the most beautiful examples of the fusion of subject-matter and style, without which perfection in a poem is impossible. De Quincey, in his essay on “ Style,” tells us of a conversation with Wordsworth, in which he said that “it is the highest degree unphilosophic to call language or diction ‘the dress of thoughts.’ ” He would call it “the incarnation of thoughts.” And De Quincey goes on to say: “Never in one word was so profound a truth conveyed . . . and the truth is apparent on consideration ; for, if language were merely a dress, then you could separate the two; you could lay the thoughts on the left hand, the language on the right. But, generally speaking, you can no more deal thus with poetic thoughts than you can with soul and body. The union is too subtle, the inter-texture too ineffable, each co-existing not merely with the other, but each in and through the other. An image, for instance, a single word, often enters into a thought as a constituent part. In short, the two elements are not united as a body with a separable dress, but as a mysterious incarnation.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_31_0	"The time having come when a change once more becomes necessary to the vision and fabric of poetry, certain people follow the example of their forebears and’ do everything in their power to hinder the progress of the poets. Yet when the modern poet is blamed for innovations in technique, in vision, and in manner, let us remember that such men as Ben Jonson, Milton, Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Shelley defended innovations in technique and originality of vision with the utmost passion, Ben Jonson, in his Discoveries, says ; ""To all the observations of the ancients we have our own experience. It is true, they opened the gates and made the way that went before us; but as guides, not as commanders. ‘Truth lies open to all; it is no man’s several.” Again, in the same work, we find: “Iam not of that opinion to conclude a poet’s liberty within the narrow limit of laws which either the grammarians or the philosophers prescribe. For, before they found out those laws, there were many excellent poets that fulfilled them ; amongst whom none more perfect than Sophocles, who lived a little before Aristotle.” On the same subject, Milton, in his Reason of Church Government, argues “whether the laws of Aristotle herein are strictly to be kept, or Nature to be followed, which, in them that know art and use judgment, is no transgression, but an enriching of art.” Dryden says: “ Better a mechanic tule were stretched or broken than a great"
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_31_1	beauty were omitted.” Shelley, in his Defence of Poetry, says: “ An observation of the regular mode of the recurrence of harmony in the language of poetical minds, together with its relation to music, produce metre, or a certain system of traditional forms of harmony and language. Yet it is by no means essential that a poet should accommodate his language to this traditional form, so that the harmony, which is its spirit, be observed. ‘The practice is indeed convenient and popular and to be preferred, especially in such composition as includes much action ; but every great poet must inevitably innovate upon the example of his predecessors in the exact structure of his peculiar versification.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_32_0	There is, undoubtedly, a vast difficulty for fresh readers in the fact that modernist poetry is bringing a new and heightened consciousness to life ; and this fresh perception of natural objects comes, sometimes, as a shock to people who are used to taking their impressions second-hand - to people who want comfort and not the truth. The senses of many people are practically unused - not through their fault, but because they have been taught that inherited ideas are the best. The result of this is that there is no connection between their senses and their brain, and it irritates them excessively when these are brought into relation with each other. The modernist poet’s brain is becoming a central sense, interpreting and controlling the other five senses; for he has learned the truth uttered by Blake, that “ Man has no body distinct from his soul, for that called body is a portion of soul discerned by the five senses, the chief inlets of soul in this age.” His senses have become broadened and cosmopolitanised ; they are no longer little islands, speaking only their own narrow language, living their sleepy life alone. When the speech of one sense is insufficient to convey his entire meaning, he uses the language of another. He knows, too, that every sight, touch, sound, smell of the world we live in has its meaning; and it is the poet’s duty to interpret those meanings.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_33_0	Modernist poets are not difficult to follow if the fact of different sense-values is remembered. Let us, as an example of this new scale of sense-values, use an “ Aubade” by a modern poet — a poem which many people pretended was incapable of an explanation. Whereas it is, in reality,extremely simple and quite explainable.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_34_0	AUBADE “‘ Jane, Jane, Tall as a crane, The morning light creaks down again.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_35_0	Comb your cockscomb-ragged hair, Jane, Jane, come down the stair.

1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_45_0	Jane, Jane, Tall as a crane, The morning light creaks down again,”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_46_0	“ The morning light creaks down again.” ‘The author said “ creaks ” because, in a very early dawn, after rain, the light has a curious uncertain quality, as though it does not run quite smoothly. Also, it falls in hard cubes, squares, and triangles, which, again, give one the impression of a creaking sound, because of the association with wood. “ Each dull, blunt wooden stalactite of rain creaks, hardened by the light.” In the early dawn, lon raindrops are transformed by the light, until they have the light’s own quality of hardness ; also they have the dull and blunt and tasteless quality of wood; as the move in the wind, they seem to creak. “ Sounding like an overtone from some lonely world unknown.” Though it seems to us as though we heard them sensorily, yet the sound is unheard in reality; it has the quality of an overtone from some unknown and mysterious world, “ But the creaking, empty light will never harden into sight, will never penetrate your brain with overtones like the blunt rain.” ‘The poem is about a country servant, a girl on a farm, plain and neglected and unhappy, and with a sad bucolic stupidity, coming down in the dawn to light the fire ; and this phrase means that to her poor mind the light is an empty thing which conveys nothing. It cannot bring sight to her—she is not capable of seeing anything; it can never bring overtones to her
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_46_1	mind, because she is not capable of hearing them. She scarcely knows even that she is suffering. “ The light would show, if 1t could harden, eternities of kitchen garden, cockscomb flowers that none will pluck, and wooden flowers that 'gin to cluck.” If she were capable of seeing anything, still she would only see the whole of eternity as the world of kitchen gardens to which she is accustomed, with flowers red and lank as cockscombs (uncared for, just as she is uncared for), and those hard flowers that dip and bend beneath the rain till they look (and seem as though they must sound) like hens clucking. “Jn the kitchen you must light flames as staring red and white as carrots or as turnips—shining where the cold dawn light lies whining.” To the author’s sight, the shivering movement of a certain cold dawn light upon the floor suggests a kind of high animal whining or whimpering, a kind of half-frightened and subservient urge to something outside our consciousness. “ Cockscomb hair on the cold wind hangs limp, turns the milk’s weak mind,’ is obviously a joke, and a joke may be permitted even to a poet.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_47_0	Critics complain of the themes that modern poets choose, themes which appear occasionally as flippant. On this subject Jean Cocteau writes: ‘ The music-hall, the circus, and American ragtime bands, all these things fertilise an artist just as life does. To turn to one’s account the emotions aroused by this sort of entertainment is not to derive art from art. These entertainments are not art; they stimulate in the same way as machinery, animals, natural scenery, or danger.” Indeed, where is the poet to go? What comfort can he take ? He is obliged, if he speaks truth, to show the world in all its triviality. He can speak of nobility also, but he would not be doing his duty if he spoke only of nobility. He must show how, through fear of life, many souls are becoming part of the stocks and stones. Therefore he writes of flower-shows where, in the coral tents of the noonday light, we can barter for the no longer disastrous stars, potted out in earthenware. ‘The people, glazed by the heat, dance to little tunes that are bright and yellow and blatant as calceolarias. No time for darkness there, excepting in the cubes of their musical-box brains, as they dance in the ephemeral sunshine. The poet writes of those flower-shows in the countrysides where Destiny is befouled, and has feathers like a hen, in landscapes where the leaves have an animal fleshiness, and old pig-snouted Darkness grunts and roots in the hovels. There the
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_47_1	country gentlemen’s lives are rooted in the mould, and they know that beyond the sensual aspects of the sky (that harsh and goatish tent) something hides, but they have forgotten what it is. So they wander, aiming with their guns at mocking feathered creatures that have learnt the wonder and secret of movement, beneath clouds that are so low hung that they seem,nothing but wooden pottingsheds for the no longer disastrous stars that win the prize at the local flower-show. ‘The water of the shallow lake gurgles like a stoat, murderously ; the little unfledged feathers of the foam have forgotten how to fly ; and the country gentlemen wander, hunting for something, hunting.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_48_0	Then, again, the poet writes of the kind of nobodies we find in the memoirs of the present, nobodies more ilded and more numerous than the sands of the shore, They roll together, and their little dry whispers overcome and deaden the sound of all the leaves in Pan’s forests, So the poets write of this new aristocracy that is an aristocracy neither of brains nor of tradition — a race of dwarfs on stilts, inhabiting hotels carved to look like clouds, clouds carved to look like hotels. And the poets write of the little children by the swan-bosomed shore of the sea, watching the side-shows to be seen upon the sand—a Punch and Judy show, bright coloured as the winter sun, or a marionette show. We were children like that once, long ago, made unhappy and terrified by the unconscious cruelty of those puppets’ fate, pulled backwards and forwards as they were, to love, to hate, to murder, to annihilation, by the mechanical actions of that ragged Hunger, the showman.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_49_0	Modern poets are building among the common movements of life, just as Wordsworth built, only the modern poet has a different stylisation. This has to be taken into consideration. He stylises his works in the same manner as that in which (varying according to the personality of their genius) the douanier Rousseau, Picasso, Matisse, Derain, Modigliani, Stravinsky, Debussy, stylise, or have stylised, theirs. That is all; if we grasp that fact the whole matter becomes easy. What may appear difficult is the habit of forming abstract patterns in words. We have long been accustomed to abstract. patterns in the pictorial art, and to the idea that music is an abstract art, but nobody to my knowledge has ever gone so far in making abstract patterns in words as the modernist poet has. ‘The nearest approach known to me is Beddoes :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_50_0	“ Adam, that old carrion-crow Of Cairo.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_51_0	There is, of necessity, a connecting thread running through each pattern, otherwise it would not be a pattern. But I can understand that the person who does not realise the necessity of cultivating all the possibilities of words as a medium — of understanding that medium — may be puzzled.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_52_0	Let us take the case of Miss Gertrude Stein, who, although she is a prose-writer and not a poet, is an admirable example of the case in point. Miss Stein is bringing back life to our language by what appears, at first, to be an anarchic process. First she breaks down the predestined groups of words, their sleepy family habits; then she rebrightens them, examines their texture, and builds them into new and vital shapes. When we read her first we are unaware of the rebuilding process ; we notice only the general breaking down of that to which we are accustomed. Yet can anyone deny the beauty of this, from The Portrait of Constance Fletcher ?
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_53_0	“ Oh, the bells that are the same are not stirring and the languid grace is not out of place and the older fur is disappearing. There is not such an end. If it had happened that the little flower was larger and the white colour was deeper and the silent light was darker and the passage was rougher, it would have been as it was and the triumph was in the place where the light was bright and the beauty was not losing having that possession. That was not what was tenderly. ‘This was the piece of the health that was strange when there was the disappearance that had not any origin. The darkness was not the same. There was the writing and the preparation that was pleasing and succeeding and being enterprising. It was not subdued when there was discussion, it was done when there was the room that was not a dream.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_54_0	The question of the making of abstract patterns is far more important at this time than any question of whether free verse is on as high a level as other forms of verse. To many people, heedless of the fact that free verse is often most intricately rhymed, the term “ free verse ” means merely an absence of rhyme, and this, excepting in the case of blank verse, appears to them iconoclastic, Yet even in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries there were quarrels between poets and men of letters as to whether rhyme gives an additional beauty to verse ; so the absence of rhyme is not in itself iconoclastic, though, in the centuries of which I speak, it appeared strange to some. Milton, in his Preface to Paradise Lost (1668), says :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_55_0	“Rhyme (is) . . . no necessary adjunct or true ornament of poem or good verse, in longer works especially, but the invention of a barbarous age, to set off wretched matter and lame metre; graced indeed since by the use of some famous modern poets, carried away by custom, but much to their own vexation, hindrance, and constraint to express many things otherwise, and for the most part worse, than else they would have expressed them. Not without cause therefore, some, both Italian and Spanish poets of prime note, have rejected rhyme both in longer and shorter works, as have also long since our best English tragedies, as a thing of itself, to all judicious ears, trivial and of no true musical delight ; which consists only in apt numbers, fit quantity of syllables, and the sense variously drawn out from one verse into another, not in the jingling sound of like endings, a fault avoided by the learned ancients both in poetry and all good oratory. ‘This neglect then of rhyme so little is to be taken for a defect, though it may seem so perhaps to vulgar readers, that it rather is to be esteemed an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_56_0	Yet the absence of rhyme is regarded by “ vulgar readers ” as a reason for deriding free verse. Would it be indiscreet to inquire if those self-appointed guardians of the purity of literature, the Yellow Press and the writers of lyrics for revues, believe blank verse to be in rhyme?
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_57_0	When we consider that it is a debatable point if a great part of Samson Agonistes is not in free verse, and that Blake wrote a defence of free verse, it appears to us as curious that this should be regarded as a modern invention. And why should it be supposed to be formless and without rhythm? ‘The trouble is, that the hearing of many people has become coarsened until they do not hear the rhythm excepting in the coarsest and most obvious forms. On this subject Coleridge, somewhere in his Lectures, says :
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_58_0	“The true ground of the mistake lies in confounding mechanical regularity with organic form. ‘The form is mechanic, when on any given material we impress a predetermined form, not necessarily arising out of the properties of the material; as when to a mass of wet clay we give it whatever shape we wish it to retain when hardened. The organic form, on the other hand, is innaté; it shapes and it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form.”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_59_0	Poets of this time are beset by three parrot-cries from the press and the public. One — and this only comes from the most ignorant — is the cry of “ free verse,” used as a term of abuse and applied, often, to poets who work almost exclusively in couplets (a form much admired jn the time of Samuel Johnson) and in quatrains. Another parrot-cry is “all technique and no great moral message,” Yet one of the most urgent needs of our time is that there should be a fresh apprehension of the importance of technique. Poetry is primarily an art, and not a dumpingground for emotions. When we are told that a poem cannot be a great poem unless it be built on a lofty moral theme, it is obvious that this belief is based on a total misapprehension of the nature of poetry. The Rape of the Lock is a great poem, though the theme is not lofty and contains no reference to morality. I have yet to discover the lofty moral message in any poem of Keats. Yet Endymion and The Eve of St Agnes are great poems. Who can claim this for Aurora Leigh, though the theme is both lofty and moral? “Two kinds of dilettanti,” says Goethe, “ there are in poetry: he who neglects the indispensable mechanical part and thinks he has done enough if he shows spirituality and feeling ; and he who seeks to arrive at poetry merely by mechanism, in which
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_59_1	he can acquire an artist’s readiness and is without soul and matter.” And he adds that the first does most harm to art and the last to himself.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_60_0	The third parrot-cry to which we are accustomed is that of “ Poetry is meant to give pleasure.” On this subject Wordsworth, in a letter to John Wilson (1800), says: “You begin... with this observation, that nothing is a fit subject for poetry which does not please. But here follows a question, Does not please whom ? Some have little knowledge of natural imagery of any kind, and of course little relish for it; some are disgusted with the very mention of the words pastoral poetry, sheep or shepherds; some cannot tolerate a poem with a ghost or any supernatural agency in it ; others would shrink from an animated description of the pleasures of love, as from a thing carnal and libidinous ; some cannot bear to see delicate and refined feelings ascribed to men in low conditions in society . . . others are disgusted with the naked language of some of the most interesting passions of men, because either it is indelicate, or gross, or vulgar.... Then there are professional and national prejudices for evermore. Some take no interest in the description of a particular passion or quality, as love of solitariness, we will say, genial activity of fancy, love of nature, religion, and so forth, because they have (little or) nothing of it in themselves ; and so on without end. I return then to (the) question, Please whom? Or what?”
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_61_0	But why should we trouble to discuss these matters further? For what use can poetry be put to, and who cares what conclusions poets arrive at? As Peacock wrote in 1820, during the lifetime of Shelley and Keats:
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_62_0	“Tt (poetry) can never make a philosopher, nor a statesman, nor in any class of life a useful or rational man. It cannot claim the slightest share in any one of the comforts and utilities of life in which we have witnessed so many and such rapid advances. But, though not useful, it may be said it is highly ornamental and deserves to be cultivated for the pleasure it yields. Even if this be granted, it does not follow that a writer of poetry in the present state of society is not a waster of his own time and a robber of that of others. Poetry is not one of those arts which, like painting, require repetition and multiplication in order to be diffused among society. There are more good poems already existing than are sufficient to employ that portion of life which any mere reader and recipient of poetical impressions should devote to them, and these, having been produced in poetical times, are far superior in all the characteristics of poetry to the artificial reconstructions of a few morbid ascetics in unpoetical times. To read the promiscuous rubbish of the present time to the exclusion of the select treasures of the past is to substitute the worse for the better variety of the same mode of enjoyment.
1-11-poetry-criticism	doc_31_63_0	"""But in whatever degree poetry is cultivated, it must necessarily be to the neglect of some branch of useful study ; and it is a lamentable spectacle to see minds, capable of better things, running to seed in the specious indolence of these empty, aimless mockeries of intellectual exertion. Poetry was the mental rattle that awakened the attention of intellect in the infancy of civil society ; but for the maturity of mind to make a serious business of the playthings of its childhood is as absurd as for a full-grown man to rub his gums with coral and cry to be charmed to sleep by the jingle of silver bells."""
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_0_0	LEISURED WOMEN
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_1_0	It is close on sixty years since John Stuart Mill first pointed to the fact that the unemancipated woman was a danger to the community. It is, he wrote, “to be considered that all the education which women receive from society inculcates in them the feeling that the individuals connected with them are the only ones to whom they owe any duty—the only ones whose interest they are called upon to care for; while, as far as education is concerned, they are left strangers even to the elementary ideas which are presupposed in any intelligent regard for larger interests or higher moral objects. The complaint against them resolves itself merely into this, that they fulfil only too faithfully the sole duty which they are taught, and almost the only one which they are permitted to practise.” Yet it is open to question whether women do not constitute a far greater danger to the community in these days of pseudoequality of the sexes than they did when The Subjection of Women was written.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_2_0	It may be worth while considering for a moment some of the changes which have taken place since that date. In 1870 it is probably true to say that not one girl in ten thousand was as well educated as her brother. Amongst those sections of the community which could afford to send their children to anything further than the pre-Education Act equivalents of the elementary schools of to-day, there was hardly a parent who even so much as contemplated attempting to educate his girls as well as his boys. If he had thought of doing such a thing he would immediately have come up against the difficulty that scarcely a girls’ school existed which attempted to give more than a slight educational polish. But the lack was not felt, because the ordinary parent did not attempt to educate his girls. As for the universities, there was not one which was completely open to girls in 1870, and there were scarcely any which allowed them even the most inadequate, grudging, and precariously held facilities.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_3_0	Women in those days were in general regarded as inferior beings, they were not far removed from a privileged slave class. The vast majority of women were almost totally uneducated, carefully trained to think personally, never impersonally, and always and only of their own and their families’ immediate interests. In any section of society that could by hook or crook afford it, they were trained also to find contentment in a life of perfectly useless leisure. And it is, of course, true that, as John Stuart Mill says, women did, almost invariably, throw their influence, such as it was, on to the side of private advantage rather than public interest: “She is taught that she has no business with things out of that (the private) sphere; and, accordingly, she seldom has any honest and conscientious opinion on them; and therefore hardly ever meddles with them for any legitimate purpose, but generally for an interested one. She neither knows nor cares which is the right side in politics, but she knows what will bring in money or invitations, give her husband a title, her son a place, or her daughter a good marriage.” But it is also true that the men who did in fact constitute the active thinking portion of the community were carefully trained not to take the woman’s point of view seriously. A man might be, doubtless often was, influenced by his wife or his other female dependants, but, if he was, he regarded it as a weakness
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_3_1	and one of which he was considerably ashamed. He was perfectly well aware that, as an educated human being with a definite place in society and a definite social conscience, he was falling below his duty if he allowed himself to be swayed by a creature not merely uneducated but actually perversely educated; carefully trained on most points to have no social conscience or ethical standard so far as the community as a whole was concerned, and possessed of that leisure which breeds decay—and, usually, he was perfectly right.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_4_0	In fact, sixty years ago, the influence of women, so far as they had any influence, might be almost entirely to the bad, but on the political and social life of the community, on public Opinion generally, their influence was practically nil, since they had, for the most part, no means of influencing these things, no knowledge of how they worked, and little knowledge of life. Even their influence on the individuals who composed the thinking community was very small, since they were carefully trained to believe men knew best, to place no reliance on their own opinion, and to give in to their husbands and fathers; whilst men were equally carefully trained to suppose that women were creatures of an inferior order, to be influenced by whom was beneath their dignity, and to give in to whom was humiliating. The women might — and probably, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, did — put their home before their country, their husband’s pecuniary and social advancement before his professional honour or his desire to contribute useful work to his generation, their own children’s comfort before other children’s health, and their own family luxuries before other people’s necessities. ‘They might be—and probably usually were—entirely lacking in any sense of the service they owed to the community. They might, and in view of their education and training probably usually did, take the shortsighted view as against the long-sighted view, the personal view as against the impersonal, the biased view as against
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_4_1	the just, the irresponsible as against the responsible. They might, and usually did, exaggerate the importance of their little finger-aches and their headaches; and allow their various minor ailments to bulk large in their minds and to stand in the way of any efficiency they might be capable of. They might for lack of education and occupation (or rather actually because of their education, since they were regarded as more attractive if highly sexed) devote an altogether undue proportion of their time, conversation, and attention to consideration of matters appertaining—if not openly, at least covertly—to sex and sexual emotions: to personal adornment and exposure with a view to rousing sex emotion in men, to discussing and considering, and glorying in sexual attraction (which they politely called love), to dwelling upon and over-stressing the importance of attributes concerned, directly or indirectly, with the sexual side of life, as, for instance, physical beauty in the young, virginity, and chastity, They might do all these things, and they might do a considerable amount of harm to social life thereby, but the harm they could do was limited because their influence was limited, and they themselves did not believe that the view of life which was all that their one-sided training and their seclusion allowed them to be capable of was the best possible. In 1870 their direct effect on national policy, on public opinion, on the public life of the nation, on affairs of public interest, was about as much as that of
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_4_2	the dogs or horses of the country. Their indirect influence was, of course, even then, a very different matter, since they brought up the children—and, even though these (both boys and girls) were early implicitly taught to despise their mother’s opinions, still their attitude towards life was largely framed in the nursery.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_5_0	During the last fifty years two far-reaching changes have occurred. In the first place, the size of the families of the professional and well-to-do classes has dwindled until, whereas in 1870 the average number of children to a family was probably round about six or seven, it is to-day more like two or three. In the second place, women in these same classes instinctively recognising, as Olive Schreiner pointed out, that they must revolt against a condition which had become dangerous alike to themselves and to the race to which they belonged, have risen and demanded more and more education, more and more opportunities for professional and commercial work, and more and more say in the social and political life of the country. As a result of the agitation of an active minority, women are now partly enfranchised, they are eligible for certain posts in public life; therefore, says public opinion, women count and must be listened to with respect.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_6_0	In 1870 there were not more than three or four schools providing a good secondary curriculum in the whole kingdom. (The best known of these were the North London Collegiate School, founded in 1850, and Cheltenham Ladies’ College, founded in 1853.) In 1925 there were something like 1500 secondary girls’ schools recognised by the Board of Education, containing an aggregate of over 200,000 pupils.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_7_0	In 1870 the number of girls being educated up to matriculation standard was probably about thirty. In 1925 the numbers were, at a conservative estimate, round about 20,000.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_8_0	In 1870 there was only one woman’s college (in the sense in which we understand the word to-day) in existence — Girton College (founded at Hitchin in 1869 and transferred to Cambridge in 1873). At Girton there were in 1870 five students. Doubtless there were in addition to the Girton students a few individuals taking University courses, but if we put the total number throughout the country at thirty, we are probably above the mark. In 1925 there were 14,000 women taking University degree and diploma courses,
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_9_0	In 1870 there was scarcely a woman in an office. In 1925 there were over half a million.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_10_0	In 1870 there was only one medical woman in the country (and she had taken her degree abroad). In 1925 there was something like 1300.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_11_0	In 1870 there was scarcely a woman teacher in anything but a private school. According to the 1921 census there were 187,352 women teachers in the country.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_12_0	Before 1870 no woman had either the parliamentary or the municipal vote, nor was any woman eligible for Parliament or for any municipal or local body. In 1925 women had the municipal vote on the same terms as men and more than three-fifths of the adult women of the country had the parliamentary vote, whilst women were eligible for one of the Houses of Parliament.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_13_0	In 1870, with the exception of Harriet Martineau, we can find no record of any woman on the permanent staff of a paper. In 1925 scarcely a paper but had one woman, and probably more, on its permanent staff.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_14_0	In 1870 no married woman owned any property. In 1925 a married woman was not very differently treated by the law in respect to property from any other person.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_15_0	In 1870 the divorce laws differed as between men and women. In 1925 they were equal.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_16_0	So far so good. During the latter half of the nineteenth century women — some women — recognised that they were becoming a danger to the community; they made a big effort, and they set in progress one of the biggest changes the world has known for many centuries.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_17_0	The change of opinion which hag followed on these changes of habit and customs, OF rather, perhaps, the change of opinion which has followed on the agitation which was necessary to bring these changes about, is an enormous one, an almost revolutionary one. In public life we see it clearly enough. The parliamentary candidate appeals to both men and women and spends anxious hours trying to decide what is likely to attract the woman voter. On almost every governing body there sit to-day two or three women. It is no uncommon thing in local government to find a woman mayor. Women, whose mothers fifty years. ago would have ‘thought it immodest to open a bazaar, are prepared to-day to address public gatherings of any size. Meetings of women are frequent. Cabinet Ministers are ready to receive deputations of women — nay, more, we have to-day a woman Minister of the Crown. Of the 206,000 teachers in our elementary schools, whose influence on the future of the nation it would be almost impossible to overestimate, some 130,000 are women. Of the 17,000 teachers in the secondary schools, more than 9000 are women. In political life, in the press, in the schools, women are—if still reluctantly—being listened to, are being taken semi-seriously,
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_18_0	But there is another new place where they are being listened to, listened to both on public affairs and on the ordering and arranging of the individual family life. They are being listened to in the home. Whereas in 1870 the man who consciously allowed himself to be guided by his wife, either in matters of public opinion or in respect to decisions of grave importance about his own career and the family affairs generally, felt ashamed of himself; to-day it is the man who disregards his wife’s views who feels a little ashamed of himself In respect to the children the change is even more marked. In 1870 “father knew best”; mother, in so far as she governed, governed as a vice-regent, as father’s deputy. To-day, even where the older children are concerned, mother’s vote is tending more and more to become the casting vote. At bottom, both in father’s and mother’s mind, there is a growing feeling that the children are somehow a bit more mother’s than father’s — that she ought to have the leading voice in decisions appertaining to them.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_19_0	To sum up, women are to-day taking a certain, though still very small, share in forming public opinion outside the home — they are taking a larger share in helping to form opinion on public affairs inside the home; and they are beginning to take the largest share in deciding the actual family arrangements inside the home. But it is worth noting that this change has come about not through any noticeable alteration in the training, lives, or habits of thought of the vast majority of women of the leisured classes, which remain in many ways very much what they were in 1870. It has come about simply through a change in public opinion. This change has been produced partly by the agitation of an active minority of intellectual, educated, and hard-working women; partly by that acceptance of the fait accompli which is always so marked a characteristic of British public opinion; partly by the recognition of good work done by individual outstanding women in various fields of labour. Because Madame Curie discovered radium, because Miss Royden can preach a more eloquent sermon than the average bishop, because Dame Louisa Aldrich Blake was one of the best surgeons of her day, the ordinary man is inclined to take the opinion of the ordinary woman more seriously than he was sixty years ago.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_20_0	But the average “‘leisured” woman has not altered very greatly. She is perceptibly better educated, so far as actual book-learning is concerned, than she was sixty years ago. Even at the worst of the private schools that is true. She plays games, and sometimes plays them well. But apart from these two points—important, certainly, so far as they go—she has changed but little. Her general education (as apart from the strictly book-learning side) still tends to make the little girl regard herself, not as an embryo citizen whose aim is to become an entirely responsible, self-governing, and independent human being, to whom will be entrusted her share of voice and influence in the governing of the community to which she belongs, her share of responsibility for the public weal; but rather as a future helpmeet, one whose business with the state and the world outside the home will be indirect rather than direct, one whose business it will be not to act herself but only to help others to act. She is encouraged not to have overmuch self-confidence, she is induced to regard herself as something slightly inferior. It is not an unknown thing to hear the headmistress of one of our great public schools for girls speak of her school as “only a girls’ school”; and this attitude is the common one amongst the headmistresses of the private schools to which the majority of the girls of well-to-do parents, who leave the home and the local high school, are
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_20_1	still sent. The schoolgirl is still encouraged to regard herself as something which cannot take care of itself by itself, as something to be guarded and protected. A headmistress was recently asked to allow one of her charges who was with her for the holidays, a girl close on eighteen years of age, to dance with some of the other passengers during a pleasure cruise on board ship, Her reply (made in front of the girl) to the two friendly and quite respectable young men who had been sent to proffer the request, was that just for once she might, if they would promise “to treat her as you would your own sister.” How, insensibly, must such an attitude of mind penetrate into every chink and cranny of the school life.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_21_0	It is true that the public schools are better in these respects — a great deal better — than the private schools, and that to-day the best of the high schools are, in some ways at least, better than many of the public schools. The women who were responsible for originating public schools for girls were amongst the finest people of their generation — they stood whole-heartedly for the full responsibility of the individual, and it is to them that is due the whole conception of the possibility of an education that should make our gitls independent, free-spirited, courageous, responsible citizens. The country owes a debt to such women as Miss Beale, Dame Louisa Lumsden, and Miss Dove, which it may be that posterity will recognise. Their influence extended not itierely to the public schools which they made, but to every girls’ school in the country. The very worst private school of to-day (and it is pretty bad) is a better place than its counterpart of sixty years ago, and a different place to what it would have been were it not for the work of such women as Dame _ Louisa Lumsden and Miss Beale. But these were giants. They raised a torch which it has not always been easy for the women who have followed them + carry with the same success. In teks day the private schools copied the public schools—are there not to-day signs that certain of the public schools tired perhaps of leading the way,
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_21_1	ae showing a tendency to take their tone from the private schools? But, however that may be, it is, after all, to the private schools that the majority of girls who leave home are still sent, and it is, therefore, the girls educated at private schools who set the tone for the behaviour of women of the leisured classes.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_22_0	The schoolgirl of to-day is allowed to suppose that, providing her father has enough money to keep her, she will be doing nothing wrong, when she leaves school, if she does what would be regarded as the last disgrace if her brother did it — if (in the hope of marriage) she lives at home idle. Nay, more than that, she is, in the average private school, implicitly if not explicitly, taught that she will actually be doing wrong if she insists on going out to work against her parents’ desire, and that her duty is to try to adapt herself to the conditions of her home life, to learn to potter about, to learn to do nothing; contentedly to accept her condition as a “kept” human being as part of doing her duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased God to call her.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_23_0	The young woman is taught, explicitly, to place a high importance on dress. She is taught, implicitly, to think a great deal about her health and her minor ailments. Is it surprising that she emerges from her school career with a sense that she is not a fully responsible human being; that she is lacking in self-confidence, lacking in sense of responsibility outside the home; that she has a conviction, j¢ she happens to be conscientious, tha, it is her duty to put her family and he, family ties before her duty to her country or to the community? Is jy surprising if she is assured that there is little need to think or to read for herself, that she need not trouble to make up her own mind but can safely accept other people’s opinions; if she is not ashamed of showing lack of self-control, of giving way to fear, either physical or moral, if she happens to feel it; if she is, in fact, without any real standard of self-respect, of self-dependence? Is it wonderful that, with this education as a foundation, after a year or two of idle uselessness in the home (that idleness which of all evil influences has the most corroding effect upon character) she becomes very much the same kind of creature that the leisured girl of 1870 became; overestimates the sexual side of life — since sex appears to be her sole raison d'étre — spends half her time thinking about her clothes,
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_23_1	regards herself as an inferior kind of creature who is not of sufficient importance in the scheme of things for it to matter if she spends her time amusing herself, and develops all those faults that the life she is leading almost invariably brings out. A girl was once asked why she spent a fine afternoon playing bridge. “I would rather Wear out than rust out,” she replied.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_24_0	Shall we be told that this type only exists among a small section of the very rich, amongst what used to be called the “Smart Set,” and that there are so few of them that it does not matter? There is a “Smart Set” or its equivalent in every suburb and in every provincial town in England, a set which spends its time playing bridge in the afternoons, motoring round to see its friends, plays a little tennis, dances good deal, keeps the most fashionable kind of dog it can afford, spends a large proportion of its time—and more of its husband’s or father’s money than he can easily spare—at its dressmaker, spends all it can squeeze on jewellery. This public reads a large number of novels, It only glances at the papers; its interest in home politics is, for the most part, confined to thinking how wicked the working-man is to want the money and material comforts which it regards itself as all-important; its interest in foreign politics is non-existent. This public is a much larger one than it was sixty years ago and it is a much more serious menace to society. Sixty years ago the man, his interests, and his amusements came so far first in the home that, by the time he had spent all he needed on sport and entertaining his friends, there was not a great deal left for spending on his wife’s and daughter’s dressing, dancing, and entertaining of their friends, Sixty years
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_24_1	ago when a woman married she normally embarked on a period of some fifteen to twenty years during which she gave birth to a child at least every two or three years, and a young family of seven or eight children does not, except possibly in the richest class of all, leave a mother much leisure.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_25_0	Idleness, the idleness that breeds decay, was, sixty years ago, confined to the unmarried or to the middle-aged. To-day, when a woman marries she has, perhaps, two children. That is not, even amongst moderately well-to-do people, a whole-time job, unless she chooses to make it so. After the first few years, in these days of school education, it is not even a half-time job. There are many mothers of small families who do not see their children, when they are in the nursery, for more than two or three hours in the twenty-four — and when they are a little older only see them during three months in the year, who do not do their own housework, but who (because they have been brought up to know no better) make the children and the home they do ot bear the brunt of looking after into an excuse for doing nothing else. It is not to be supposed that these mothers do not love their children devotedly—of course they do. It is rare to find a mother who can help doing that. But loving does not in itself constitute an occupation. Sixty years ago women of this kind had very little freedom, to-day they have a great deal. If people are to be brought up to live the life of self-indulgent slaves it is safer for the community that they should actually be slaves.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_26_0	But it is not only the number of idle, useless women which has increased enormously during the past sixty years; their influence also has increased. Today they are listened to, they help to set the tone of the society in which they move. They, largely, make the attitude towards life of big sections (and important sections) of the community. And they make it what they have been brought up to make it. They put idleness, the one thing they know, as the highest good; they teach the men and the young women of their set to value idleness, to dislike work, to value material comfort, personal adornment, and social advancement, to judge people upon how they dress, and by whom— socially—they know; and since sex is their profession, they put an enormous emphasis on sex, on discussion of sex, on consideration of “sex problems,” on the importance of sexual attraction, on the methods of keeping feverish sexual desire. They are much franker about this side of life than they were sixty years ago, because they are freer, ee since they owe what position they have entirely to sex, they naturally set enormous store by it. When they discuss sex questions they are discussing professional questions. They set no standards of duty towards the community, because, for the most part, they have none. Their influence is, as Mill declared it was sixty years ago, “anything but fayourable to public virtue.” They understand the danger to the community involved in war and
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_26_1	they have a standard of duty to the community in war time, but, short of war, their motto is home first, community last, and they spread that attitude of mind throughout their set. They are listened to to-day by men as they were not sixty years ago, and there is grave danger that their unhealthy, immoral, and corroding attitude towards life may spread through the community.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_27_0	But if the effect of the social system of to-day on the most useless type of woman is deplorable, and if the type of society for whose existence she is mainly responsible exists, as it certainly does, not merely in Mayfair but in every suburb in England, she is in fact, prevalent as she is, not the most characteristic type of young English woman. The majority of normal young women instinctively reject the bridge-party ideal of life. But that is not to say that the present education of women, the present attitude towards women, leaves them unaffected. They are taught from their cradles, in their homes, in their schools, that they are different from men, that their first duty is not to the community but to the home, that, above all, their function in life is to become mothers, that the one sacred thing in life is the maternal instinct. No one ever teaches them that the maternal instinct unregulated and unsublimated can be just as dangerous, just as anti-social, and just as non-moral as any other untaught and unregulated instinct. They are taught to mistrust — as well as to emphasise — their sex instinct; but they are taught that the maternal instinct needs no mistrusting, no pruning, no directing, and that nothing should be allowed to stand against it. They grow up and they marry; they have children, and their natural instinct, that instinct which everyone about them has taught them to regard as sacred, immediately tells them
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_27_1	to sacrifice everything and everyone to their children.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_28_0	Sixty years ago they would probably have been saddled with a husband who considered that he, his comfort, his career, his service to his generation, should stand before the children. Today the husband is, on the whole, inclined to agree with them that the children should come first, before his comfort, before his career, before his duty to the community — he also has been brought up to revere the sacred maternal instinct. But that is not all. The instinct that was meant to go round a large family, that sixty years ago was, so to speak, spread thin amongst seven, eight, or ten children, is to-day concentrated on the two, or at most three, which is usually all that the average not too well-to-do young couple feel justified in having.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_29_0	If the mother is conscientious, the children are probably well brought up in the sense that they are taught kindness, good manners, friendliness, truthfulness, and all the other usual English virtues, but they are allowed to know from. their very earliest childhood that the whole world, so far as their parents are concerned, is centring in them, that the best is always kept for them. Their mother cannot bear to see them enduring the faintest shadow of discomfort or foregoing the least chance of a treat; if she had a dozen children and a husband who insisted on being put first of the lot, she would have to bear it quite often; but she has a husband who is prepared to aid and abet her, and so few children that each can usually be given its heart’s desire. She does not mean to spoil them, in one sense perhaps she does not, but she lets them know that they come first, she saves them every jar, she sees that they get better food than anyone else in the house, she gives them rather more treats than the family income can afford, and if it comes to a question between their interests and the husband’s career, as it quite often does, it is his career that goes: the family comes first, the home comes before the community, and the children are brought up to expect that that should be so. The idea that she, the mother, has any serious duty in
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_29_1	life apart from her children never even occurs to the average married woman. That the very fact that her duty to her children is the highest duty she knows must prevent her from doing that duty as it should be done, never occurs to her either. She is convinced that she is doing her full duty to the community through the home, by bringing up her children. The idea that she is actually bringing up the children badly because she is doing that and nothing else, that she is not justified in giving full reign to that sacred maternal instinct of hers along the path of least resistance, never enters her head. Along with the deepest sense of responsibility towards her children, she carries a sense of comparative irresponsibility towards anything beyond her children, and to-day she is beginning to imbue her husband and her children with her own attitude towards life.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_30_0	The effect on the children and young people of to-day is obvious enough. Because their mothers have not yet developed a social conscience as apart from a maternal conscience, and are giving them the attention and spoiling meant for a family three times their size, they are growing up soft, expecting the best as of right, imagining that they are ends in themselves, and have a right to look upon the world as a place out of which to snatch the greatest possible happiness and amusement and material prosperity and comfort for themselves. The best thing they find to do, even when they happen to be altruistic, is to try to give others the same life as themselves, and to suppose that the endeavour of the whole world should be to see that everyone in it has, as a right, amusement, happiness, and material comfort.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_31_0	“The greatest happiness of the greatest number” is a soft ideal, the ideal of an age that is losing its ideals. And this lack of idealism, this debasing of ideals of conduct, both for private and public life, comes, in the first place, from the women: from them because to-day they have influence—at least in the home—and yet are not trained to use that influence wisely, are not trained to have a sense of responsibility to the community, because they are trained to think of themselves as something a trifle inferior, not to regard themselves as directly responsible citizens; and are not treated either by the State or in the home as fully responsible people from whom the best in courage, self-reliance, and service, may be demanded. At its worst this attitude towards women leads to glorification of idleness and the vices that attend on idleness, at its best to a putting of the duty towards home and children before the duty to the community.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_32_0	In addition to the bridge-playing women of Suburbia and the conscientious mothers there is, however, another type: the young public school and university women, the increasing number of women who go into a profession. It remains to be considered how the present attitude towards
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_33_0	women affects them. Of course the general softness induced by over-spoiling is there. Apart from that, in the public school to-day— as in the secondary school, as in the private school—they are taught that they are of secondary, indirect importance, their school is “only a girls’ school”; and not so much courage or endurance is expected of them as it is of boys. They are more cosseted than are their brothers, they are allowed to place their minor ailments before their play and before their work. They are taught, usually implicitly but occasionally explicitly, to believe that women’s work is inferior in quality to men’s, that less need be expected of them. They are taught not to rely on themselves but to turn to men for care, protection, and advice, and to think that—apart from motherhood—men’s work matters more than women’s, and that the highest ideal for a woman is not to embrace a profession or engage in paid work but to do some kind of unpaid work (probably slumming) for charity. If, in spite of all these tacit discouragements, they decide to go through a university and embrace a profession, what becomes of them? As a rule, unless they adopt so exacting a profession that they are cured of the faults of their training, their tendency is, wherever Possible hg, do as they have been taught to do, to put their health and their home before their work. Trouble or illness at home even when not serious, is regarded
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_33_1	as an all-sufficient reason for the breaking of any professional engagement — home ties, even though the young women concerned are not yet responsible for their homes, come first. Their own health is apt to come a good second. Apart from these very serious disabilities, their attitude towards life is what might be expected from their upbringing whether at home, at school, or at the average university. They care for their own work, often passionately, they have had to battle hard for the right to do it against many insidious foes; but they have not much self-confidence even in their own work, so that it is unlikely that many. of them can ever, except when here and there genius, which nothing trammels, breaks through, do really well in it; and in other relations of life they have amazingly little self-confidence. How can they trust themselves when they have been taught to trust no woman?
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_34_0	They pride themselves frequently enough on not thinking very much of women or of women’s achievements. They pride themselves on not being feminists. ‘They think it shows. intellectual freedom and lack of bias to recognise that women are inferior, and, except for a few outstanding exceptions, will never really make good—what it really shows is that they are true to the traditions of their training, and that they have their fair share of sex-snobbery: that is, a desire to stand in with, and to stand well with, the stronger sex. They have, for the most part, no sense of loyalty to the women who struggled through the years of the nineteenth century to get for them the advantages and the privileges of which they are now availing themselves, It has not been part of their heritage, either in their homes or in their schools, to learn at what cost the advantages they enjoy were won. They treat their privileges of education and training as if they had dropped like manna from heaven, and it never occurs to them that the acceptance of those privileges ought to involve loyalty to the movement that won them—how should it? No one has ever put that point of view before them.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_35_0	The majority of those who adopt a profession still drift into teaching. Not in most cases from any sense of vocation, but because teaching is still the obvious thing for an educated woman to do, still one of the professions in which she believes that she may be moderately sure of gaining a certain competency, and because teaching requires a less expensive post-graduate period of training, apprenticeship, or waiting for success than do most other professions.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_36_0	What effect does the home and school training we have described have on the young woman who in her turn goes back to teaching? She has been taught always, both implicitly and explicitly, that only in the field of sex.can she gain complete victory. It is true that she knows that some women have found success and happiness in other fields, but their success has never been brought very prominently before her. Successful men she has known and been taught to regard with hero-worship; successful women—very few. It is the men who have occupied the head-lines in the papers—it is the men in every capacity of life who have counted. She has been taught that as a human being a woman is inferior toa man; that her one great value to the community lies in her capacity for motherhood; that there lies her one chance of escaping a sense of inferiority and of failure. When she takes up teaching she believes herself to be risking her chance of marriage —it will mean seeing so few men—and, to her, marriage is the one word that spells complete success. Naturally enough she tends to become discontented. She is an intelligent young woman, she has read the modern psychologists, she is as frank with herself as she knows how: to be, and she explains her discontent to herself with all the courage and cocksureness of youth. She is, so she tells. herself, suffering from the unsatisfied need of sex, her sexual and maternal
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_36_1	instincts are going unfed; this seems to her amply sufficient explanation of her dissatisfaction. But in reality her trouble lies deeper than that, it is an instinct more profound than sex or maternity that is going unfed: the instinct that demands that every human being shall feel himself to be successful, or at least capable of becoming successful, not sidetracked from all chance of success. She would find her maternal and sex instincts considerably less pressing and troublesome if they were not so powerfully reinforced by the belief, inculcated from her earliest years, that only in their gratification could a woman hope for success.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_37_0	Another difficulty haunts her and tends to reinforce the belief that her work is of no real value and is not much worth doing; and often prevents the concentration, the sense of security and certainty, which makes for success. From her earliest years she has been taught to place family above community. At any moment that any member of ee family needs her she is expected to abandon the work she has chosen and for which she has been carefully and expensively trained, and run and take up the post of unpaid housekeeper to him or to her. She may come to love her work, may be making a big success of it, but in the background is always the conviction, both of training and tradition, that, if her family asks it of her, she must leave the place in which she is doing really valuable work for the community, that for her means success and happiness, and go back to them. So she never feels quite safe, she never feels quite settled. She has~ always two roots. Perhaps next year, perhaps ten years hence, her mother will die and her father will be left lonely, and of all the family it is she, the unmarried woman, who will be expected to leave all she cares for and go back and fend for him. Or her sister will leave two young children, and, pending the time when her brother-in-law decides to marry again, it is she, the unmarried woman of
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_37_1	the family, whose conscience will prick her if she does not throw up a post of fifteen years’ standing and ruin all her chances of a successful career, in order to act as stop-gap mother to them. Very likely she, who has learnt independence, who is accustomed to command rather than to obey, is not the one who finds it easiest to adapt herself permanently to life with a brother-in-law who prefers his women fluffy, or with a father whose views on the duties and position of women have been nurtured by his Victorian mother and all-too-gentle wife. But neither she nor anyone else thinks that the brother who has never found a satisfactory job since the war, or the rich married sister who fills in her time motoring and playing bridge, should feel any sense of responsibility in the matter. These things, by tradition, lie within the province of the unmarried woman. Instinct tells her that she is of more use carrying on the career she loves and has been trained for than looking after a father who will probably be happier without her, or ruining her chances of successful work for the sake of acting as stop-gap housekeeper. But conscience is usually the product rather of training and public opinion than of instinct, and, even if instinct wins, always at the bottom of her mind she is haunted by anxieties and doubts—has she done right? .. . Always she has two roots.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_38_0	The truth is that the half-way house is always a perilous place, and that the _ present position of women constitutes a grave danger to the whole community. Women have been given freedom, but they have not been given training, opportunity, or the sense of responsibility that would teach them to use that freedom wisely.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_39_0	To keep a slave class is dangerous to any community; to keep that slave class ignorant, idle, and in closest touch with and bound by all the most intimate individual ties of custom and affection to the people responsible for the brain work, the initiative and the leading of public opinion, is more dangerous still. Those few men and women who in the middle of the last century realised this danger and set to work to educate and to free women were attempting a vital service to the community, a service without which civilisation must sooner or later have perished.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_40_0	But there is a condition of society even more dangerous — nay, far more dangerous — than the keeping of such a slave class as we have described. That condition is reached when the class is taught to keep its slave ideals, is allowed to stay idle and irresponsible, but is set free. ‘That is the condition which we have reached to-day. The harem system is dangerous enough, but it is safety itself compared to the system which sets the ideals of the harem free to permeate the market-place. It were better to go back to the conditions of 1870, to keep—at whatever cost of suffering, of wasted ability, and even of danger—half the population ignorant and helpless at the mercy of the other half, than to stay as we are to-day, with our women free, or mainly free, but trained, in the leisured class, to idleness and irresponsibility, a focus of decay in the very centre of life. (Shall we be told that the leisured class is so tiny a fraction of the whole community that what happens there is a small thing? There could be no greater fallacy. Whether we should or should not have a class able, either in view of its earning or its inheritance, to afford, if it chooses, comparative leisure for some of its members; or whether, if we have one, it should be chosen by the haphazard methods of to-day, is a question we are not here concerned to discuss. What is certain
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_40_1	is that to-day we have such a class— and under every conceivable system of government we shall have at least an intelligentsia which will continue to approximate to it in essential respects —and that, taking it in its broadest sense as including all those liable to pay income tax, it comprises 99 per cent. of the educated people of the country, and of those who lead in thought, in fashion, and in action: that, in fact, it sets the tone for the whole community, -and that, according to whether it is itself in a state of health or of decay, the community is bound to stand or fall.)
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_41_0	We are not concerned to dwell at any length upon women in the professions, since they are only negatively affected by the present position of women. It is true that their value to the community might be very much greater than it is. If more were expected of them they would have far more to give, their standard would be higher, their capacity and ability greater, and—as teachers—their influence on the rising generation infinitely more wholesome and self-respecting. But it is not they who constitute the danger of which we speak. On the contrary, their value to the community is already considerable. Their existence—in increasing numbers —is the bright side of the change that has taken place since 1870. It is the women in the home, the leisured and the semi-leisured women, who constitute a positive danger, who do, in fact, act as a focus of poison to the whole of society.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_42_0	. ‘ .
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_43_0	We have pointed to the grave danger which the present position of women constitutes to the community—what 1s the cure? Above all, a change of heart is needed . . . but a change of heart does not come by itself... .
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_44_0	Firstly, we have got to recognise that idleness is the unforgivable sin which breeds rot and decay wherever it is found. No human being—and it matters not a rap whether that human being is man or woman—has the right to remain idle, or semi-idle, and no human being has the right to expect the community, whether through the medium of her father or husband, or in any other fashion, to keep her, if she is not giving her full day’s work in return. If the small family has come to stay, then with it must come the realisation that motherhood is no longer a full-time job—is not in itself sufficient to justify existence.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_45_0	Secondly, we have got to recognise that you can only safely give people liberty if you educate them to believe that they can be, and must be, worthy of it, as worthy as anyone else in the land. That is a task for our teachers, but it is a task they are as yet incapable of performing, because before you can teach others you must yourself believe —and as yet the majority of them do not believe. How can they be taught to believe? Mainly—since they are as pervious to public opinion as any other section of the community—by a change in public opinion. How that change is to be brought about it is not our province to discuss. But some things must strike the most casual observer.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_46_0	It will never be possible to persuade public opinion that women are the equals of men so long as salaries and wages as between men and women are unequal. It will never be possible to persuade public opinion that women are independent, fully responsible human beings and complete citizens, so long as the law protects them specially in ways in which it does not protect men. If there is one thing which more than anything else tends to perpetuate the sense of inferiority, of not needing to stand upon their own feet, amongst women, it is the existence of such laws as those which forbid night work or Sunday work to women engaged in factories—but not to men, and such provisions as that contained in the Government’s Factory Bill restricting hours of work for women—but not for men—to forty-eight per week. And be it noted, these laws, though they apply to wage-earning women only, affect public opinion in respect to all women. Again, it will never be possible to persuade public opinion that women can be as capable, and should be as free, as men, so long as trade unions are allowed, without protest, to bar women from the best-paid jobs and processes.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_47_0	Thirdly, it will never be possible to make public opinion believe that women are as capable of full citizenship as men so long as in fact they are not full citizens. Women have not to-day got political equality with men, and the political inequality from which they still suffer inevitably reacts, as must any form of political inequality, on the whole public opinion of the country. It helps to form the opinion men hold of women, and it helps to form the opinion women hold of themselves. It helps to make both men and women expect less of women than of men, less courage, less balance, less judgment, less public spirit. . . . To expect less is to receive less.
2-11-leisured-women	doc_32_48_0	The generation of 1870 set out to do a great service, but its task is not yet done, and if we of to-day leave that task unfinished we shall find that, so far from having saved society, the action of the early feminists has merely hastened its decay.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_0_0	HISTRIOPHONE
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_1_0	A Dialogue on Dramatic Diction: persons, BENTUAS and HELTUBADA:
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_2_0	scene, a library, in which every book wanted is immediately at elbow, and opens miraculously at the required place.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_3_0	HELTUBADA. Nothing, my dear BENTUAS, seems to me more tedious than the efforts poets make to write their plays in verse. The commonplace they try to dignify in stilted forms; and things, which plainly stated might have life, they bring to dreary ruin. Why do you laugh?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_4_0	BENTUAS. At your paradox: you’ve been railing against blank verse, and all the while employing the ‘stilted form.’ Dryden would have delighted to take you in illustration of his remark on ‘‘ prose mésurée ; into which the English tongue so naturally slides, that in writing prose, ’tis hardly to be avoided.’’! But as to your matter, I’m not myself averse to an artificial medium ; though my line would rather be that blank verse is not a suitable stage instrument as written by our modern poets; and fluently used, as in later Shakespearean times, is not artificial enough.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_5_0	HELTUBADA. Can you really be in favour, so late in the day, of a return to ‘ poetic drama,’ and all the horrors of a Stephen Philips? Can you bear the idea of our dramatists hitching themselves into verse on the most ordinary and tea-table occasions?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_6_0	"BENTUAS. I’m afraid you’ve been listening to the older generation with their mystic notion of poetry, and their idea of ‘heightening’ sense, a sad heritage from the Restoration, ""How naturally Shakespeare soars into verse whenever his subject requires it,"" we hear; at which claptrap I always think on the one hand of :—"
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_7_0	Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_8_0	"And do the office of a warming pan (Henry V., II. :) and on the other, of the prose passages in Hamlet. I see no difference between drama and poetic drama; plays are well written or badly written, that is all. The medium, the choice of diction, are the author’s own affair. Thus when Mr. Saintsbury, for whom every lover of literature must feel the greatest respect and gratitude, writes ""but Shakespeare moulds his blank verse so impeccably that it never sounds unnatural doing prose office,""! I fail to grasp his meaning."
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_9_0	HELTUBADA. I am equally at a loss when you say there is no difference between prose and verse; and to show the absurdity of your contention, I would ask how it is that most of the drama of our greatest period was written, not in prose, but in the ‘ other harmony ?”
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_10_0	BENTUAS. That it is an ‘other harmony’ I hasten to agree: it is the point of the ‘ otherness’ that has been falsified. The question as to why the Elizabethans wrote in blank verse is quickly answered: they found it easier.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_11_0	HELTUBADA. That is the crank’s reason Shaw maintained in his prologue to The Admirable Bashville; but his own practice—nobody admires his sinewy phrasing more than I do—scarcely bears him out.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_12_0	BENTUAS. The reason sounds cranky for being only half stated. Blank verse may not be easier to write, but it is easier to say than the bulk of prose, and much more readily remembered. That at once gives it a higher merit as an actors’ medium, an opinion towards which I hope to lure you by quoting Vanbrugh’s case. You remember how Cibber said in his Apology that ‘‘ there is something so catching to the ear, so easy to the memory in all he writ, that it has been observed by all the actors of my time that the style of no author whatsoever gave their memory less trouble’’? Now his blank verse, which the Mermaid editors print as prose, is execrable stuff, pr@sodically considered; but it has the qualities Cibber noted, though not to the same degree as has his prose. And the reason is that his prose is very often better blank verse. Look, for instance, at this piece written in truncated lines :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_13_0	Behold a burning lover at your feet, His fever raging in his veins! See how he trembles, how he pants ! See how he glows, how he consumes ! (The Relapse, V. 4)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_14_0	which for rhythmic structure compares badly with any passage of his current prose.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_15_0	HELTUBADA. You used the phrase ‘ prosodically considered,’ as though there were any other way of intending, one’s mind upon verse.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_16_0	BENTUAS. Indeed there is, I think, another way, which I will, if you like, call -‘ histriophonically considered.’ But I’m afraid that if I go on I shall scorch your ears with heresy.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_17_0	HELTUBADA. You cannot shock, because I hold no doctrine.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_18_0	Benruas. Yet you must remember, Heltubada, that I’m discussing, not the making of verse, but the result to the ear; just as when I speak of the architecture of Hampton Court I refer to its effect on the eye, and not to the calculations of Wren. Neither must you ever forget that when I use the term 'blank verse,’ I mean only that written on purpose for the stage.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_19_0	HELTUBADA. I hate your odious provisos. We may never meet, but we can amicably pursue the same game. ;
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_20_0	BENTUAS. I would judge blank verse, then, not one pea of prosody (which, of course, it has, but whic pe concern of ours) so much as on a histriophonic Putas bhe must ask ourselves the question: Does it fulfil the requirements of a good stage instrument? Such should impose the stress on the right word for sense, and so make the lines actor-proof: it should be flexible, that is, admit of pace variations so as to lend itself to narrative speed as well as to rhetorical force; and, finally, it should be easily fitted to the capacity of the human lung and voice when speaking English at a pitch above the ordinary.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_21_0	HELTUBADA. Then we need no longer harass our hearts with trochaic substitutions, acatalectic lines, and all the elaborate frivolity of the text-books ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_22_0	BENTUAS. No more than a fisherman bothers about the atomic fabric of his gut; and by this method we shall save ourselves the phrase so often seen in the correspondence columns of the literary papers, “‘ Surely Shakespeare’s ear would never have tolerated ’’ what as, likely as not, he passed as perfectly sound.?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_23_0	HELTUBADA. I remember Coleridge boggled at a line in Hamlet,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_24_0	How prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter ...
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_25_0	and remarked, ‘‘ A spondee has, I doubt not, dropped out of the text.” With the irresponsible levity of most Shakespeare commentators, he proposed to insert ‘‘ Go to” before ‘“‘ these blazes,’ or ‘‘mark you ”’ after “‘ daughter,’’ founding his argument on the “‘ uniform respectability ”? of Polonius!? But tell me how you think the Elizabethans came to discover that blank verse was the easiest of all mediums?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_26_0	BENTUAS. Like many other rare finds, it seems to us who come after the event, as due to a succession of happy chances that produced the right men just when the knowledge needed to be matured.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_27_0	It was luck that made the Earl of Surrey graft the form off an Italian tree onto our English stock just a few years before Thomas Sackville came to write a tragedy. Craftsman’s curiosity led the latter to choose for Gorboduc (1561) the new rhymeless, decasyllabic metre, and everybody knows the rather stiff beginning :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_28_0	The silent night that brings the quiet pause, From painful travails of the weary day,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_29_0	but, as his pen grew less pupil, he escaped from such neat arrangement of iambic feet, and ventured into :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_30_0	Though we remain without a certain prince, To wield the realm, or guide the wand’ring rule, Yet now the common mother of us all, Our native land, our country, that contains Our wives... (V.2.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_31_0	and so on. The change is not great; the line is structurally end-stopped, but there is less of a hobbling effect. Gascoine did not much improve upon him, limping valiantly through Jocasta (1566), not only shackled to his verse form, but exuberantly rattling his chains.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_32_0	HELTUBADA. Certainly I can never read him without recalling the fragment of Catullus,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_33_0	At non effugies meos iambos,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_34_0	and I can imagine an audience cowering under :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_35_0	But fiercely straight, the armies did approach Swarming so thick, as covered clean the field, When dreadful blast of braying trumpets sound, Of doleful drums, and thund’ring cannon shot Gave hideous sign of horror of the fight. (IV. 1)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_36_0	BENTUAS. At the beginning blank verse structure was far too rigid, and the pack of University wits, well kept together by Gabriel Hervey, did little to free the playwrights. ‘
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_37_0	HELTUBADA, I see that at any rate you’re determined to scarify the prosodists.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_38_0	BENTUAS. Far from it; their works, sometimes delightful, are always useful, because they make us think the thing anew. But English verse can usually be made to fit into any system provided we make enough play of pauses, inversions, and substitutions. I protest that the spectacle of prosodists eagerly scanning a page of verse, muttering to themselves while with falling thumbs they keep the time, fills me with reverence. Moreover, the works of Gascoine himself, Campion, James VI. of Scotland, Webbe, and others, was invaluable; and even Puttenham, when not floundering in ‘‘ A generall resemblance of the Roundell to God, the World and the Queene,”’ or so, had something useful to say. But in criticism practice precedes theory, and we come to the second lucky chance——
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_39_0	HELTUBADA. When ‘“ Marlowe’s thought in thunderous music spake.’’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_40_0	BENTUAS. —and made Tamburlaine one of the first of the popular successes. Custom by now decreed that plays were to be written in verse — Lyly is here rather beside our point — the rhymeless kind had classical precedent, and so the instrument persisted, to lie to hand for the great school of author-actors who created the Elizabethan stage. But their method of attack was new. They were not concerned to write poetry, or ‘ poetic drama ’; they panted to write plays. Young, active, rebellious against the jargon of the pedants, glowing with the romantics’ dislike of restraint, they adopted blank verse, not as a limit the artist willingly.imposes upon himself, but as a medium which they could freely employ as the handiest servant of their muse.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_41_0	HELTUBADA. To quote Swinburne again, you believe Marlowe to have been the “‘ creator of English blank verse ?’?!
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_42_0	BENTUAS. Almost, from my point of view; for as it existed, say at about 1585, it was by no means a good stage medium. It was unwieldy, slow, and above all, evenpaced. The actor-authors learned by experience in the theatre what, were the essentials of a good stage instrument
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_43_0	HELTUBADA. I’m all agog for you to unfold your heresy and prove blank verse the easiest form of writing for the English stage.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_44_0	BENTUAS. My dear HELTUBADA, I have no wish to prove anything: I’m following a track, and you agreed I The Age of Shakespeare. Christopher Marlowe, we might hunt together. And here I must insist that what we are now discussing is not poetry, but rhetoric, and that ‘“‘ the business of an orator,’’ as Hazlitt remarked,’ ‘‘ is not to convince, but persuade; not to inform, but to rouse the mind.’’ Actors are in a sense orators, rhetoric is a special instrument, and that is why the prose of Donne’s most terrifying sermons is often like that of Jonson’s most amusing plays.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_45_0	I would begin by saying that all English verse may be regarded as the arrangement of stresses in a sentence; and the dramatists found that the most convenient measure for the actor was a line of approximately ten syllables, with, on the average, three stresses. For certain effects there might be fewer stresses, or more; but the typical line became with Marlowe, Kyd, and their follower Greene, formed on the pattern of :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_46_0	And ride in triumph through Persépolis. (Tamburlaine.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_47_0	To sée the slaighter of our énemies. (Tamburlaine, I1., III., 5)

1-5-historiophone	doc_33_49_0	Bróught for eternal péstilence to the world. (Orlando Furioso.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_50_0	where the stresses fit themselves easily to the sense. Five stresses had been almost entirely abandoned, and when four were used they served to slow down the declamation :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_51_0	Is this is the fáce that launched a thoúsand ships And búrned the topless towers of Ilium. (Faustus.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_52_0	HELTUBADA. Hm! I see.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_53_0	Eyes, life, world, heav’ns, hell, night, and day, See, search, shew, send some man, some mean, that may——
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_54_0	What d’you think of that?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_55_0	BENTUAS. It sounds like a piece of Gerard Hopkins.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_56_0	HELTUBADA. Arid is, in point of fact, another morsel from The Spanish Tragedy (I11. 2). 1 admit it an exception, but it serves to test your rule.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_57_0	BENTUAS. I could help you to dozens of such tests, but I make no rule; I merely suggest a norm. And in the earlier playwrights, especially in Kyd, it is often doubtful where the stress should come, even when it is plain it can come only three times. Take, for instance :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_58_0	Hieronimo, why writ I of thy wrongs? (Spanish Tragedy)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_59_0	It’s clear that the weight must come on Hierónimo and on wrongs, but may come either on why, or writ, though not, conveniently, on both.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_60_0	HELTUBADA. Your blank verse, then, would tend to become trochee-dactylic or anapaestic, rather than iambic?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_61_0	BENTUAS. I would prefer to avoid those terms, admitting frankly that they would land me in a most unhappy muddle.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_62_0	HELTUBADA. What, then, is your blank verse? Can your .‘ approximately’ ten syllable line be expanded and squeezed indefinitely, after the manner of Alice, by nibbling a mushroom labelled Three Stresses ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_63_0	BENTUAS. I’m not discussing prosody, but I may say in passing that I don’t believe poetry can be scanned on a stress basis alone, leaving the unstressed syllables to take care of themselves. As to blank verse, like Meister Eckerhart and his God, I would rather state what it is not than what it is, though I hope to be able to illustrate what it performs. At any rate, it is not any collection of ten syllables.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_64_0	HELTUBADA. ‘ A Mr. Wilkinson, a clergyman.”’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_65_0	BENTUAS. I would give you, instead of that justly famous line, a sentence from The Education of Henry Adams:
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_66_0	"""--more than he could struggle with; more than he could call on himself to bear.’’ Nothing will force those last ten syllables into tolerable verse; but"
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_67_0	More than he could bring himself to bear
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_68_0	is no very poor one, with nine syllables. For myself, I would rather make isochronous periods the cadre of blank verse, and to my mind, these four lines from Catiline (V. 5) are really five verse periods of three stresses each :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_69_0	1 For no man éver yet changed péace for war 2 But hé that mednt to cónquer. 3 Héld that purpose. 4 There’s mére necéssity you should be such, 5 In fighting for yoursélves, than théy for others.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_70_0	This would also dispose of the difficulty of the ** fourteener ’’ in Lear (I., 1) :—

1-5-historiophone	doc_33_72_0	HELTUBADA. How dispose? Yet another Procrustes?

1-5-historiophone	doc_33_77_0	where I don’t think he meant the second line to be imperfect, padded out with a pause, but a rather slow, emphatic, three-stress line, rhetorically, if not prosodically, of the same value as the others. HELTUBADA. This is a far cry from Marlowe.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_78_0	BENTUAS. Let’s go back to him then, or rather, to his last play. I give you:—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_79_0	Base Fortune, now I see, that in thy wheel There is a point, to which when mén aspire, (3) They tumble headlong déwn : that point I touched, And, séeing there was nd place to mount up higher, Why should I grieve at my declining fall ?— Férewell, fair quéen; wéep not for Mortimer, That scorns the world, and as a traveller, Goes to discover countries yét unknown. (Edward II., V. 6.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_80_0	There we have the paragraphing about which such a pother is made—but the breath-unit, so to speak, is still stress-grouping in threes, and perhaps the third line should contain two units. But the phrasing, to borrow an image from music, is no longer restricted to the bar; nevertheless the stress-grouping remains embodied in the larger rhythm. The progress, however, does not seem to have been from the rather merciless hammering of Marlowe to the lighter touch of Shakespeare but rather—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_81_0	HELTUBADA. My dear Bentuas, forgive me: abandon the chronological method for the moment, or I shall imagine myself at a lecture, and die, like a student’s wit, of academic strain. I should like to hear what you have to say about enjambment.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_82_0	BENTUAS. Don’t think I’m huffed if I beg you to let me talk of run-on lines, or, if you wish it, straddling: but so as not to be led off by this red herring, I will at once rush in, and declare that I think it often a mere fake.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_83_0	HELTUBADA. I’m inclined to agree; and remembering that we’re hunting together, was going to use such a notion in support of your theory that the blank verse really ends when three stresses have been accomplished. Prosodists may faint in horror, or cry that they cannot stop to bandy speech with owners of such indelicate ears, but as far as stage speaking goes, it seem to me that
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_84_0	Daffodils / that come before the swallow dares And take / the winds of March with beauty
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_85_0	is identical with the words as actually written, where ‘ daffodils ’ ends a line. The same can be said of

1-5-historiophone	doc_33_87_0	BENTUAS. The Winter’s Tale presents many difficulties, and I would almost say that in it Shakespeare had ceased to write blank verse, and was seeking for some other medium. The likeness of his prose to his poetry in that play lends colour to the guess. But
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_88_0	Flower-soft hands/ that yarely frame the office. From the barge,/ a strange invisible perfume Hits the sense/ of the adjacent wharfs ...
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_89_0	seems to me to show that in Antony and Cleopaira, Shakespeare, without abandoning the three-stress structure, was making the breath-unit comprise several groupings, and that the straddling was not a technical feat, but merely accidental. I admit, of course, that writing it as I have, I’ve smashed to smithereens
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_90_0	Swell with the touches of these flower-soft hands,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_91_0	HELTUBADA. I feel that you’re carrying me along too quickly, and that somehow we've over-run the scent. I’m not yet convinced of your three stresses, or as to why the dramatists found such verse seductive.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_92_0	"BENTUAS. Samuel Daniel noted that ""every language hath her proper number or measure fitted to use and delight,”! and — Dryden apart — the notorious difficulty of not writing blank verse shows it to be the mould into which the English language most willingly runs. It is easier for an actor to declaim poor verse than to speak bad prose, because the framework of the verse forces the stresses into groups that are easy to Say, and into periods the lungs can easily master. Stage speech is something other than literature; it is not meant for the inward ear, like the poetry of Marvell or Coleridge, like the prose of Bolingbroke or Landor. It should be rather crude and obvious. You don’t agree?"
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_93_0	HELTUBADA. On the contrary; for it must be admitted that the drama is primarily a crude artistic medium. It may be other things as well—it has been everything—but crudeness, brutality even, is the first condition of its existence. ‘‘ L’art est, par essence, absolument inintelligible au peuple.’’! while the appeal of the drama has to be immediate, being made to the many-headed monster of the pit. Thus proud artists write their plays without ‘the most remote view to the stage,’? and Congreve knew The Way of the World would fail to please the general. One might almost say ‘ No melodrama, no drama.’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_94_0	BENTUAS. The Marlovian verse was at once seen to be a superb rhetorical medium, for the pit agreed with Puttenham that ‘‘ this meeter of ten syllables is very stately and heroicall.’’ It was just what was wanted by author and audience alike, for both revelled in the more,sbombastic play, and found the regular three-beat, end-stopped line admirably to the purpose. Chapman, slightly abating Marlowe’s rhetorical glamour, wove a less regularly stressed line, with more straddlings and feminine endings. In his hands the medium became more flexible, without losing the bony quality he needed for his obstinate thought, as in :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_95_0	While this same sink of sensuality swells, Who would live sinking in it, and not spring Up to the stars and leave this carrion here For wolves, and vultures and for dogs to tear? (The Revenge of Bussy D’ Ambois. V.I.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_96_0	where you will see moreover, that no man can be guilty of a mistake in the sense, or of error in placing the stresses.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_97_0	HELTUBADA. Go on with your infallibility theme, and then I'll deliver you a little speech that has been gathering in my mind while you have been talking.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_98_0	BENTUAS. I’ll go straight to Shakespeare, giving you only one example from him :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_99_0	But I much marvel that your lordship, having Rich tire about you, should at these early hours Shake off the golden slumber of repose Tis most strange (5) Nature should be so conversant with pain, (Pericles. III.2.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_100_0	and I would have you note, in line five, the need not only for three stresses, but for those three stresses to be placed exactly as they are for the line to go at all. With Webster, in The Duchess of Malfi especially, to insist on three stresses only, wonderfully clears up the actor’s problem, as in :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_101_0	A slave that only smelled of ink and counters, And never in’s life looked like a géntleman (III.3.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_102_0	which, pointed as I have done it, seems vividly to express Ferdinand’s vitriolic indignation.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_103_0	Finally, to give myself one more support, I would ask you how, on any system but one something on the lines I’ve indicated, you would get an actor at once to balance correctly :— What is beauty, saith my sufferings then?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_104_0	As a mainly trochaic line, as I have said it, it’s perfect, but also perfectly inane. You see how to apply my three-stress theory ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_105_0	HELTUBADA. ‘Indeed, the alteration of that accent does a great deal, Mr. Bayes.”
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_106_0	BENTUAS. Do I really deserve to be mocked out of The Rehearsal? Suppose we have your shattering speech.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_107_0	HELTUBADA. I’m going to burden you with a brief discourse on one prime aspect of the drama; to suggest that no instrument which fails to aid this aspect is good for dramatic purposes; and to ask you to apply this criterion to verse.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_108_0	BENTUAS. By all means. Even if I think your track is false, it may cross another which leads towards our quarry.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_109_0	HELTUBADA. When Macduff hammers upon the gate, it is not because we feel Fate knocking at the portal that we are moved. ‘The theatre allows no time for nice conjectures; a fact De Quincey should have remembered when he wrote his famous rigmarole. It’s because the speed of the drama has changed. When in The White Devil Flamineo leaps up from his pretended death spitting out 'O cunning devils! now I have tried your love,’ we are stirred, not kecause we’re surprised, but because new movement is introduced; as any botcher up of melodrama knows when he sends a man on to the stage bellowing ‘‘ Lights, more lights.”
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_110_0	What makes a work dramatic is not so much its obvious shape, as the structure of its changes of motion: for me The Waste Land is dramatic, and Abraham Lincoln is not. Aristotle understood this, but made his divisions too formal; the Elizabethans most certainly knew it: but it’s fatal for us to try to write plays on either the Greek or Elizabethan model, for the rhythm which moves one age to warmth may leave another chilly. The kind of change which will stir our generation is perhaps to be found in the gyrations of an aeroplane, the swirl of street traffic, or the breaking away of a Rugby scrum. But there will always be the sea, or the swing of half a flock of rooks dropping across the others, and the sway of a mother crooning to her child.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_111_0	A play, I think, is structurally composed, not of Sardoodledoms, or Ibsen hot-houses of preparation, but ot carefully proportioned speeds, succeeding one another in varying length and intensity. Intensity can be fast or slow; fast as the final rant in Faustus, slow as the great Giovanni-Anabella scene of Ford. Thus speed will not depend upon tension, so much as upon the texture of the language. The action must, of course, back this up; the urgent speed of the words in the battle scenes of Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida—you remember the magnificent ‘ Renew! Renew!’ speech —-would be no good if the action was as tedious as the library scene in Cato. Speed may, of course, be quite the reverse of intense, like the staff orders in Henry V; and so may slowness, as in the drearier passages of Brome.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_112_0	The dramatic moment, as I suggested at first, is that at which a change of speed intrudes; this may be entirely emotional, as at Ferdinand’s entry into the Duchess of Malfi’s dressing room; or it may be purely physical, like an inrush of dancers. For in the drama, as in daily life, it’s not speed we feel, but change of speed; not motion, but acceleration. And since it’s my belief that dramatic effect can be brought about by the play of words alone, I would like to be convinced that blank verse is more capable of procuring this result than any other medium.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_113_0	I’ve done. I’m afraid I’ve been dry as a cracknel.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_114_0	BENTUAS. On the contrary, and I’ll argue with pleasure that speed is the chief glory of this way of writing.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_115_0	The rather primitive rhythm which Marlowe made the norm of all blank verse, if the easiest to say, is, for that very reason, not suited to the expression of any deeply subtle thought. The single fact that no actor can make a mistake in it goes to show that there is probably not much about which a mistake can be made. Just now you mentioned Henry V., but I think that in the passages of narrative, command or detail of the historical plays, wé see Shakespeare, not altogether successfully, striving to endue his verse with speed. It was not, however, until he bent the medium to subtler imaginings that he was forced to give it rapidity, for here failure would have meant abandoning the medium. But more than ever the stresses had to be obvious, and, if the actor will leave them alone, his lines still unerringly say themselves, although they form sentences of a length almost unmanageable for the voice if written in anything but this ‘ measured prose.’ It was only this speed which made it feasible to act his long plays in a short time. Also, his verse at its most characteristic is easily remembered; a capital point, for the actors of the Phoenix and the Globe—to except the Queen’s players— probably had as scant time for rehearsal as the mummers at Elsinore. But the words, as Hamlet remarked in justifiable bitterness, emphatically must be allowed to come trippingly from the tongue.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_116_0	HELTUBADA. Poor Shakespeare! How he still suffers! I remember only the other day talking to one of the best known of our Shakespeare producers, and complaining that on a certain occasion the great lines of Claudio in Measure for Measure, ‘‘ Ay, but to die, and go we know ia not where .. .’’ had been atrociously mangled. He F replied that his actors always spoke their lines best before they were familiar enough with them to be able to suit the expression to the word - register emotion' I believe is the phrase; but that while they had to concentrate their attention upon the mere saying of the syllables, the effect was delightful.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_117_0	BENTUAS. I can well believe it; actors always try to improve upon their author, and seldom credit an audience with sense; wheretore, though I can forgive them as men, I can rarely tolerate them as artists. But to illustrate my previous statement about the speedy treatment of comge plicated length, let us take a passage from that very play, written after Shakespeare had rid himself of the earlier tradition. Angelo is speaking :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_118_0	Admit no other way to save his life (As I subscribe not that, nor any other, But in the loss of question) that you, his sister, Finding yourself desired of such a person, (5) Whose credit with the judge, or own great place, Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the all-building law: and that there were No earthly mean to save him, but that either, (9) You must lay down the treasures of your body, Yo this supposed, or else to let him suffer : What would you do? (Measure for Measure. 11.4.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_119_0	That's all one sentence; it’s not difficult to say as such. bal Aside that is, without any ‘ heightening' balderdash, or any attempt to bring out the presumed iambic ground-swell of blank verse, a mistake cannot be made. How fool-proof it is on my system of threes I can example from the fifth line, where, instead of bothering about 'great place' which offers some prosodic difficulty, I lean on ‘ own,’ which is histrio-phonically correct, sound and sense well married. The whole speech, indeed, ripples along admirably, precisely because, built upon what I have described as “ breath-units,’ it’s born to be recited. Also I would have you note, that when Shakespeare wished to be peculiarly impressive, and markedly clear, as in the ninth line, he wrote a Marlovian verse. In the remainder of the scene this happens repeatedly.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_120_0	HELTUBADA. I confess I’m not certain whether the stress should be on ‘lay’ or ‘ down,’ though it obviously must be on ‘ treasures ’ and ‘ body.’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_121_0	BENTUAS. You raise an issue where I’m afraid I am indeed heretical, for I think that stress may cover more than one syllable, though it is usually slightly more on one than on the other. Here I think it is on ‘ lay,’ and I need not really have given you that point. But in the line from Sejanus,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_122_0	A race of wicked acts Shall flow out of my anger and o’erspread . . . (II)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_123_0	I think one has to link ‘ flow out’ into one stress ; just as in All for Love (Act V.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_124_0	Time has unrolled her glories to the last And now closed up the volume
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_125_0	the words ‘ closed up’ have to be — histriophonically — welded together,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_126_0	HELTUBADA. Isn’t this a little too ingenious ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_127_0	BENTUAS. It would be if stresses or quantities were solid things you could arrange in rows like beads; but they’re not, for I agree with Omond that ' counting of stresses ' but a shade less mechanical than counting of syllables.””? And while on this point, I would like to make clear my belief that there are not only two kinds of noise, but scores of inflections, one can make between the highest point of a phrase and the lowest; just as that most exciting of prosodists, Thomson, holds that long and short is far too rough a division, and that there are longs and longs, shorts and shorts, not merely in a two to one ratio, but jogging along amicably in three eighths and four fifteenths.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_128_0	HELTUBADA. When the art of writing becomes that of arithmetic | get bored. Besides, I still want to have proved the aptness of blank verse for rhythmic changes, because I have a theory of my own: but, as the French officers said to the English at Fontenoy, ‘ Please fire first.”’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_129_0	BENTUAS. I wish we could go through Catiline together, scene by scene, speech by speech. I suppose that, until Dryden, Jonson was the most conscious of our dramaturgical artists, and he took more pains than the author of Aurengzebe. Catiline, at least, seems to me a rich example of the speed-structure of a play, and the speeds are almost entirely produced by the nature of the verse. Cicero’s great accusation tirade, for instance (IV. 2.), would be intolerably long were it not for the subtle changes of swiftness. Slow, with four stresses where he would be argumentative, the moment he wishes to move the Senate, Cicero goes to three stress rhetoric, achieving even a thirteen syllable line where he would be especially impressive; I mean
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_130_0	while they sit : They approve it; while they suffer it, they decrée it.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_131_0	which is as good as Swinburne’s would-be decassyllable
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_132_0	Illimitable, insuperable, infinite.’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_133_0	But the great example of the moving power of threestress rhetoric is in Petrius’s speech to his men (V-1-);
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_134_0	It is my fortune and my glory, soldiers, This day, to lead-you-on the worthy consul Képt from the honour of it by diséase: And I am proud to have so brave a cause To éxercise your arms in. . . “
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_135_0	HELTUBADA. We must certainly go through it some time. But have you no shorter example than the whole of Catiline ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_136_0	BENTUAS. One you know by heart — Antony’s famous tub-oration in Julius Caesar. Shakespeare by then had his technique at his finger tips, had experimented, and had written almost all the verse portions of Midsummer Night in three-stress metre, as he had much of Richard II. His opinion of four beats as outmoded—and note that Richard III. is almost entirely in this measure—may be gathered by his relegatign of them in Hamlet to the bumpy rant of the Player King.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_137_0	But to return to our muttons. Antony, at the begin| ning of his speech, is not sure of his audience; he can’t | go rushing blithely on, he must go step by step: so watch the stresses :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_138_0	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; (5) I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. (2) The evil that men do lives after them (2) The good is oft interred with their bones,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_139_0	where the three knocks of the last line seem to clinch the phrase. In the early part of the speech, too, the lines are mostly end-stopped: but once he feels he’s got a grip of his audience, and no more needs to step delicately, he tumbles out his three-stress, run-on lines:
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_140_0	But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world: now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_141_0	He’s ceasing to be argumentative, and is becoming rhetorical. But there is, in the earlier part of the speech, a line I would have you note to show how flexible the three stress system is, which can either space its emphases equally, as in :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_142_0	To-morrow, and to-morrow and to-morrow,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_143_0	or can huddle them all together in three consecutive syllables:—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_144_0	So are they all, all honourable men.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_145_0	But you said you had a theory.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_146_0	HELTUBADA. Which I propose to treat as all theories should be treated, that is, abandoned as soon as it ceases to bring further enlightenment. To state it will clear me of the charge you made just now of thinking verse a comic, of,course, in its rather obvious sense, and not in its recondite meaning which would make it include Troilus and Cressida, La Vida es Sueño, and Le Festin de Pierre, though the “‘ purest ’? comedy may stir profound emotions.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_147_0	BENTUAS. The man who can sit unmoved through Le Tartufe, or remain cold at certain passages of The Way of the World, never deserves to go to a theatre.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_148_0	Hetrupapa. In the kind of comedy to which I refer, we are interested not so much in what is going to happen, as in what we actually see on the stage: our attention must be held by the ungainly antics and clotted speech of the ‘rude mechanicals,’ we amg chuckle at the very sound of Sir Toby Belch’s voice, and follow every gesture, note every word of the nimble fairy who masquerades in the mountainous flesh of Falstaff. That is why those passages are written in prose.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_149_0	BENTUAS. Yet, forgive my stubborness, it is noteworthy that the most famous of all Falstaff’s speeches is a blank verse couplet, though cunningly tucked away.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_150_0	HELTUBADA. You mean?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_151_0	BENTUAS. The better part of valour is discretion, In which the better part I’ve saved my life.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_152_0	But though this supports my argument, it needn’t alter yours.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_153_0	HELTUBADA. Now, to show that the Elizabethans didn’t regard prose as degrading, it’s enough to observe that the scenes in which they sought the uttermost depths of passion and suffering are also invariably put in prose. I mean the ‘distraction’ scenes, for I cannot even momentarily hold the theory that the poets of that time regarded madness as funny.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_154_0	BENTUAS. Invariably?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_155_0	HELTUBADA. I can, indeed, think of one in verse, Penthea’s, in The Broken Heart; but Ford softened his horror with Sentiment, and the rule is otherwise. Ophelia, of course, 1s no argument, since so much of Hamlet is in prose. But take the madmen in Webster’s Duchess (IV.2), or his Cornelia, when Marcello is first killed (The White Devil, V.2), and she is already half distracted. Blank verse, again, would not do for the winding of Marcello’s corpse (V.4), and that scene had to be set, if not in prose, at least in the more arresting medium of rhyme. Flamineo feigns distraction in prose (III. 1), and when Lear goes really mad, which he doesn’t do completely, I think, until I1V.6, his shattered mind raves itself out in that medium. The like occurs even in Greene’s burlesque, Orlando Furioso. It’s the same at the end of The Maid’s Tragedy, when Calianax is broken in brain, and I don’t see why I shouldn’t claim on my side Lady Macbeth in her sleep-walking. There, once the need for tense immobility has gone, the doctor breaks out into verse, and the movement goes on again. But I see I am overstepping into my last and largest field.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_156_0	BENTUAS. That the Elizabethans used prose merely as a rhythmic brake ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_157_0	HELTUBADA. That is what I think, and I shall confine myself to Shakespeare for two or three instances, which I picked out the other day haphazard. Look first at Timon of Athens. You'll have observed that the second dinner scene (III. 6) is mainly in prose, while the earlier one (I., 1) is almost entirely in verse. Now note exactly where the second dinner comes; it is between the scene where Alcibiades storms against the senators, and that where Timon rages like the embodiment of a curse before the curtain of the wall of Athens. Both are swift and angry scenes, full of imprecation. The dinner scene, too, is angry, and not lacking in oaths; but except where the host bursts out fuming against his callous friends, is in prose, purely I believe, to make a change in rhythm.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_158_0	Coriolanus, V.2, is also a good example of changes of tone produced almost entirely by alterations of the measure. The scene opens with the arrival of Menenius from Rome to speak with Coriolanus ; and this part, being explicatory, is in verse.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_159_0	BENTUAS, It also contains the involved metaphorical speech
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_160_0	28 HISTRIOPHONE
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_161_0	about ‘ amplifying Coriolanus’ fame,’ which would be difficult to manage in prose.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_162_0	"HELTUBADA. Your gun once in hand, you may kill a bird or a badger with it. Next, to get a sense of stop, the guards turn to prose, indicating also the pulling up short of Menenius. They become, however, rather more fluid a. in the longer poetical speech, with sentences like ""Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as this?"" Then Coriolanus comes, to be met by Menenius with a very dragging speech in prose, of which we impatiently await the issue, so that when the renegade Roman flashes out in verse, the dramatic effect, almost entirely due to the change of speed, is tremendous. After that, the speakers revert to prose, thus slowing down the scene, for a very moving passage in verse comes after, just as a like one goes before."
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_163_0	BENTUAS. I fancy you could work out as in Hamlet?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_164_0	Heitusapa. The last scene is clearly enough constructed on this model, and is in three parts. The first is the rapid précis of events Hamlet retails to Horatio, and is in admirable, spanking narrative verse. It is now necessary to put on the brake so as to make effective the overwhelming rush of the final moments of the play, and so the intermediate passage with Osrick is in prose. And if the structure here is not very subtle — why should it be - the grave-digger scene may please you better. It comes immediately after the violent Laertes scene; and its prose forms an admirable breathing space before Hamlet sweeps us off into the almost unbearable atmosphere of his emotional outburst when he jumps into Ophelia’s grave.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_165_0	BENTUAS. I, too, have scented this beast, and to show you how much I’m with you, will take you back to the porter scene in Macbeth, which you mentioned just now. That stupendous previous scene — especially after the 'Macbeth does murder sleep’ passage, should go very hastily, if still more so after the temporary stillness produced by the first knocking. After that we must be made to wait to hear our hearts beat with the suspense, fretting at the slow prose of the porter and Macduff while the horrible discovery is being made in the adjacent room. At Macbeth’s re-entry events once more begin to Stir. The presage of Lennox’s verse speech sets our emotions on the shift, and on we go, in faster and faster measure, through ‘‘O horror! horror! horror!’’ to the panicstricken gallop of

1-5-historiophone	doc_33_168_0	BENTUAS. I think, indeed, my dear Heltubada, we must stop to take breath and see, after all, what quarry we’re after. I’ve become so interested in the forest, I’ve almost forgotten the hunting. You suggest we’ve killed: I think, rather, we’ve shot a jay when out pheasant shooting.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_169_0	HELTUBADA. Let’s go back, then, to where we began the argument. You said, originally, that though not against an artificial medium, you didn’t think blank verse, at least as written at the present day, quite suitable for the drama.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_170_0	BENTUAS. We needn’t retrace our steps all the way; only to where you interrupted me, long ago, and begged me to be less sidereal.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_171_0	HELTUBADA. I apologise.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_172_0	BENTUAS. You needn’t, and I won’t try your patience. But I was about to say at that moment that the progress of blank verse was not so much from Marlowe’s to Shakespeare’s, but rather to a suitable form of prose, which, like blank verse would be ‘prose mésurée,’ but measured in a different way. For if verse strays from the easily uttered, readily apprehended stress-grouping of the primitive forms, as it is almost bound to do when it abandons rhetoric, it either moves in the direction of the ‘‘ other harmony,’’ or becomes something, which, however it may be for the chamber, is inadequate to the stage.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_173_0	HELTUBADA. You mean that what ultimately killed dramatic verse was its growing realism, just as its too great resemblance to life eventually stifled the Elizabethan play?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_174_0	BENTUAS. Toa large extent. But also because that Sas rate in the hands of Shakespeare, it became too, subtle. What d’you make of this from The Tempest?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_175_0	There be some sports are painful, and their labour/ delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness/ are nobly undergone; and most poor matters/ point to rich ends. This my mean task/ would be as heavy to me, as odious; but/ the mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead, / and makes my labours pleasures. (III. 1)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_176_0	To me only the last seven syllables have anything of the blank verse rhythm, though you will see that the whole passage fits into a sort of breath-unit system.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_177_0	HELTUBADA. It has certainly lost the original swing: and what has become of your three stresses?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_178_0	BENTUAS. They are still occasionally useful in overcoming difficulties, such as Miranda’s line in that very passage
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_179_0	nor have I seen : More that I may call mén, than thou, good friend :
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_180_0	and where Shakespeare still wished to be rhetorical, he had recourse to the Marlovian verse,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_181_0	And like the baseless fabric of this vision, The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces... ;
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_182_0	But on the whole Shakespeare now used an instrument too fine for the stage, and it often comes to me to wonder if we don’t here brush against one of the several reasons that made him quit the theatre: It no longer pleased him to write the cruder verse that best befitted plays: | wanted more exquisite effects, which he knew would became ineffective, even if not bungled by the poorer performers. The divine strains of The Phœnix and Turtle caused the voices of the actors to seem the very ashes in which beauty, truth and rarity lay enclosed ; and, himself Prospero, having once ‘required heavenly music,’ there was no other way but to ‘ abjure rough magic.’ The form he had made would no longer hold the things he felt and saw, and, like Rimbaud, he found paroles païennes unendurable.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_183_0	HELTUBADA. You would say, then, that he ruined blank verse, as old bottles are broken when rich new wine is poured into them?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_184_0	BENTUAS. Rather that it was bound to outgrow itself, for the condition of life is change.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_185_0	Hettupapa. 'Outgrow' seems grandiose gilding for 'decay.’
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_186_0	BENTUAS. But not so fantastic if you consider it, as I would like to do, together with the growth of stage prose.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_187_0	HELTUBADA. I heartily wish you would.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_188_0	BENTUAS. My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack : for my part, the sea cannot drown me: I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues, off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_189_0	That prose, as you know, is in the scene of The Tempest next after that I quoted just now. But, if the ring of the last passage is still in your ears, d’you see a grave difference ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_190_0	HELTUBADA. I admit the stress-spacing and the breath-unit, to use your terms, seem much the same.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_191_0	BENTUAS. Now I’ll ask you to run your eye down this piece of Tourneur : O might that fire revive the ashes of This Phoenix! yet the wonder would not be So great as he was good, and wondered at For that. His life’s example was so true A practique of religion’s theory That her divinity seemed rather the Description than th’ instruction of his life. (The Atheist’s Tragedy, III. 1.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_192_0	HELTUBADA, Queer verse indeed !
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_193_0	BENTUAS. But what admirable stage diction ! musical, fluent actor-proof, compelling the sense. And now I'll give you some Jonson :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_194_0	Nor shall you need to libel ’gainst the prelates, / and shorten so your ears against the hearing/ of the next wire-drawn grace. Nor of necessity/ rail against plays, to please the alderman/ whose daily custard you devour: nor lie/ with zealous rage till you are hoarse. Not one/ of these so singular arts,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_195_0	That is from The Alchemist (III. 2).
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_196_0	By my integrity, I’ll send you over to the Bankside; I’1l commit you to the master of the Garden, if I hear but a syllable more. Must my house or my roof be polluted with the scent of bears and bulls, when it is perfumed for great ladies? Is this according to the instrument, when I married you? that 1 would be princess, and reign in mine own house; and you would be my subject, and obey me?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_197_0	That is from The Silent Woman (III. 1). Well?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_198_0	HELTUBADA. I must confess that if I didn’t know the former play was in verse and the latter in prose, I should have felt inclined to hit on the second passage as being the one in verse, especially from the last phrase.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_199_0	BENTUAS. There is no a priori reason why Volpone and The Alchemist should be in verse, and The Silent Woman in prose; nor why Catiline should be in the first medium, and Cynthia’s Revels in the other. Jonson was not bothered by the requirements of subject, and notions of heightening: he was intent upon experimenting towards a form of prose that would be as effective and as rapid as blank verse without dropping into the swing Sometimes a little too noticeable in Volpone.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_200_0	HELTUBADA. You insist that stage verse is something difterent from stage prose ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_201_0	BENTUAS. As a full orchestra, with drums and trombones 18 from a string quartet, Listen to Jonson off the stage’

1-5-historiophone	doc_33_203_0	(The Masque of Blackness.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_204_0	HELTUBADA. Out of whelks, or murex-shells. That’s very lovely.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_205_0	BENTUAS. More beautiful than the verse of the masque itself, but impossible to say loud.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_206_0	HELTUBADA. But where, exactly, does the distinction between your two proses lie?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_207_0	BENTUAS. Keep the rhythm of the masque passage in your ears, and try this from The Silent Woman (IV. 1). It is, of course, from Ovid’s third book of The Art of Love’ :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_208_0	If she be short, let her sit much, lest when she stands she be thought to sit. If she have an ill foot, let her wear her gown the longer and her shoe the thinner. If a fat hand and scald nails, let her carve the less and act in gloves.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_209_0	Where “‘ exactly ’’ the distinction lies it would be hard to say. Nevertheless, the play passage seems just to fringe verse, and I’ve given you the reference so as to quote Congreve’s version :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_210_0	The nymph too short, her seat should seldom quit, Lest, when she stands, she may be thought to sit;
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_211_0	HELTUBADA. You would upset the Aristotle-Dryden opinion then, and declare that plays should be written in that kind of prose which is nearest verse?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_212_0	BENTUAS. The whole subject needs to be probed, and I wish Saintsbury would embark upon it to give us a companion volume to his fascinating study of prose rhythms, in which he definitely avoided the stage. But we were discussing the decay of blank verse, and as we’re due to dine at Odeienherria, I must plunge. My idea is, that as the seventeenth century wore on into its second and third decades, verse lost its Marlovian structure and became indistinguishable from stage prose. It was none the less good stage verse, adapted even to the marvellous poetic flights of The Tempest and The Winter’s Tale, althouch the structure of the prose in those plays hardly differs from it: ‘‘ A malady most incident to maids ” is of the same kind as ‘‘ A picker-up of inconsidered trifles,” Anyone can find longer and more convincing extracts, but I would rather leave Shakespeare alone for the moment, to speak of lesser artists—Massinger, Middleton, Shirley, but not Fletcher, for whom I have an unreasoning aversion.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_213_0	HELTUBADA. You may omit Massinger: he’s the most finished craftsman of his age, and A New Way to Pay Old Debts is machine-made to an extent William Archer ought to envy. His verse has long been recognised as being admirable resilient prose; but it’s all so slick that it’s clever without character. Massinger added nothing, he developed nothing, he spoiled nothing.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_214_0	BENTUAS. I'll give you Middleton, then. You'll agree that in some plays, as in A Game at Chess, he wrote with great prosodic beauty; but for the more part he used blank verse as a household drudge. But if this medium became worse and worse as a poetic form, it did not for that reason turn out a less happy dramatic vehicle. What happened was that 1t became more and more the rule for the playwrights simply to make sentences in vaguely blank verse groupings and string them loosely together. Here, for instance,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_215_0	Errors? nay, the city cannot hold you, wife, (11 syll.) But you must needs fetch words from Westminster‘ (10) I ha’ done, i’faith, (5) Has no attorney’s clerk been here a’late, (10) And changed his half-crown piece his mother sent him (12) Or rather cozened you with a gilded twopence, (12) To bring the word in fashion for her faults (10) Or racks in duty and obedience ? (10) Term 'em even so, sweet wife, (7) As there’s no woman made without a flaw. (10) (A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, 1., I)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_216_0	Anyone familiar with Brome or D’Avenant can better, or worsen, that example.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_217_0	HELTUBADA. Jasper Mayne is mighter still. How’s this from A City Match?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_218_0	Gentlemen, Shall we dine at the ordinary ? I will enter you among the wits.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_219_0	BENTUAS. Monstrous hot ice indeed. But let me show you some prose of Middleton’s, which I’ve copied out from The Mayor of Queensborough (III., 3), in this way :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_220_0	The deadly sins will scorn to rise by thee, (10) If they have any breeding, as commonly (11) They’re well brought up: ’tis not for every scab (10) To be acquainted with ’em: but leaving the scab, (12) To you, good neighbours, now I bend my speech. (10) First, to say more than a man can say . . .(9)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_221_0	HELTUBADA. Enough! enough! There’s not much difference, though difference there is.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_222_0	BENTUAS. So the process went on of welding together verse and prose to produce a third medium, stage speech. Progressively we see stage diction losing the rhythms of blank verse, yet still tending to employ the three emphasis phrase, such as Cokain’s
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_223_0	Nowadays, young ladies for a while Do mantle their affections in dislike. (The Obstinate Lady.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_224_0	Or the four, as with D’Avenant’s
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_225_0	They do frisk and dance In narrow parlours to a single fiddle That squeaks forth tunes like a departing Pg. (The Witts II.)
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_226_0	But stage language became very ‘ joyless and pallid,’ even when not villainously bad, and one wonders whether the playwrights didn’t sometimes cast a longing look back to the rhymed quatrains of Daniel’s Cleopatra or the formal graces of Selimus.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_227_0	HELTUBADA, Which they probably read about as much as we study the plays of Robertson, The fact is, it all became too easy, because the form which made for realistic flow was bound also to make for flabbiness of matter, a result noted by Dryden’s perspicacious mind and which spurred him to his reforms. As often happens, the less the dramatists had to say, the more verbose they became, as we see from Shadwell, that playwright in spate. Economy of material, of course,must not be mistaken for poverty of thought, nor must the second for the first. However, it’s fair co say that Meredith spoke foolishly when he praised Congreve for being ‘ at once concise and voluble,’’ since it is only when we have the wherewithal to be extravagant that we can afford to be restrained and pithy.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_228_0	BENTUAS. You have illustrated what is precisely my objection on the later form of blank verse ; it was not artificial enough, and it’s interesting to note that the first attempts to pull this measured prose together were made in the direction of tagging it with rhyme. Jonson set the example tentatively in The Sad Shepherd, though the ‘‘last draught of his quill,” Mortimer, was in the very best tradition of blank verse. It’s noticeable, too, that Otway, beginning with rhymed couplets, went on to blanks that are nearly always end-stopped and nearly always four stressed. The lesson of the decadence had been too palpable to be ignored, and Otway is before Shakespeare because he’s after Dryden, But blank verse was doomed; I know nothing satisfactory after certain short passages of Rowe, for though he’s more flatulent even than Addison, he’s much more supple.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_229_0	HELTUBADA. Swinburne’s Duke of Gandia acts admirably for he there abandoned his gorgeous tapestry, and I should have thought the verse portions of Herbert Trench’s Napoleon would have satisfied your conditions.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_230_0	Aide Breet Hose examples, and there is, of course; | leat a te I still look for salvation to a new kind
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_231_0	j there is nothing our dramatists seem to cei so much as diction, Masefield’s Pompey the eat, in short, sharp prose sentences, is at least an interesting experiment: but being too much concerned with people’s ideals, and not enough with their desires, he’s ° cast all the scenes in a kind of Maeterlinckian melancholic which makes them all go at exactly the same pace, So that the experiment doesn’t carry us very far. Of our successful playwrights only Shaw appears to regard stage speech as something with a nature of its own, but his theatre prose overmuch resembles that of his prefaces. He rarely moves, for he’s too urgent to convince, and the instruments used for these purposes are, as we’ve seen, as wide apart as a hammer from a handsaw. Like all those who don’t carefully forge out an especial weapon, he’s sometimes bogged in verse, and Morrell in Candida roars you as loud as any poet-lion :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_232_0	Then help to kindle it in them, in me, Not to extinguish it. In the future, When you are as happy as I am, I will be your true brother in the faith.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_233_0	HELTUBADA. It strikes as rhetoric, yet works not persuasion,’’ as Bussy D’Ambois has it. But still, it’s easy enough to find in anybody a collection of ten or so syllables that you can call blank verse.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_234_0	BENTUAS. I only take the obvious, what seems to me obvious, that is. For if you look for iambics you’ll select different lines from those that I discover. Saintsbury, for instance, seeking iambics, finds in a passage of De Quincey,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_235_0	Her kingdom is not large or else no flesh Could live,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_236_0	which I admit I missed. On the other hand he didn’t notice, in the same passage,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_237_0	But narrow | is the nation | that she rules,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_238_0	which he scans as I show,! and which thus seems to me the perfect type of rhetorical blank. But it is almost inevitable that if we use the common forms of speech we shall drop into verse. Etherege, who rivals Congreve for fineness of ear, was often guilty, if guilt it is, and Lady Woodville cried out :—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_239_0	Oh no! I hope you do not know him? He is The prince of all the devils in the town, Delights in nothing but in rapes and riots. (The Man of Mode, II. 3).
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_240_0	Congreve himself erred, though not, I think, in The Way of the World, and could write,
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_241_0	Sure I was born To be controlled by those I should command: My very slaves will shortly give me rules How I shall govern them. (The Double Dealer, V. 13).
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_242_0	For there is nothing more true than ‘“‘ In English, indignation makes blank verses ”?. indeed, not only wrath, but any emotion does so. The translator of R.U.R. continually fished up such lines as, Oh for another hundred years of time, while in the emotional scene of Outward Bound the lines came tumbling out so packed that I couldn’t scribble them down fast enough on the edge of my programme.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_243_0	HELTUBADA. And were they good ones?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_244_0	BENTUAS. 1. I gave my soul for Anne, and she gave hers... 2, Until they beat us down, so bruised, so hurt... 3. They smeared our love, smeared with their dirty lies...
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_245_0	So they dribbled out, all end-stopped. But though Sutton Vane stumbled, I think he unwittingly took a right direction : we should get back to our natural breathunit of about ten syllables, but must avoid the too easy snare of verse. ilde, who whatever his defects, had at least thought about phrasing, sometimes hit this mea” Nothing will induce me to take his hand. I think his coming down here disgraceful,”’ Jack says in The Importance of Being Earnest, and Algernon remarks, “ One should always eat muffins quite calmly.” But Wilde's compass was very restricted; he failed to establish any kind of beat, and his paragraphing is flabby, as though deliberately slowing down, he’d lost his sense of drive.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_246_0	HELTUBADA, But if you think blank verse has so many good points, is indeed, hardly to be avoided, what’s your objection to our modern verse playwrights ?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_247_0	BENTUAS. They’re too slow. They’ve forgotten that stage speech must be rapid, and a play overbrimming with vinous juice. Economy of words and ideas, which no great playwright, even Racine, has practised except at carefully prepared moments, is a vicious error, which produces, not . feasts, but the meat tabloids of Ibsen; while the etiolation of Yeats is as bad as the stodginess of Drinkwater. Bottomley, who has body, is too even.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_248_0	HELTUBADA. I see your point. You want an instrument that shall be artificial enough for art; a prose as far removed from ordinary speech as your type blank verse, though not, of course, the ‘rhythmed prose’ that leads to the Sargasso sea of Paul Claudel. You want a medium that can be at will swift, rhetorical, or quiet.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_249_0	BENTUAS. I want, above all, a medium that shall be actor-proof, actor easy, and clear, and which, though artificially made, shall sound on the stage as naturally rapid as the flowing of a stream.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_250_0	HELTUBADA. Whom d’you consider has most nearly approached perfect stage prose; Jonson?
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_251_0	BENTUAS. Sometimes; though the prose of All Fools is perhaps better of that sort, and Marston’s Dutch Courtezan is by no means to be despised. Jonson took Chapman’s style and hardened it, so that he’s occasionally a little too gaunt, too apt to close heavily on a succession of loaded iambs. He’s perfect for his own purposes, but not for that of others. I certainly want a prose in which we feel “the skull beneath the skin,’ but I want the skin to be of an exquisite texture. Such prose is rare — Shakespeare, Congreve, Landor, though the last is too long-drawn for the stage. Shakespeare sometimes wrote first-rate Jonsonese, as in Timon’s speech (IV., 3), which begins “A beastly ambition,’ but in Hamlet, which was, I think, his great experiment in stage prose, he achieved a subtler, surer melody ;—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_252_0	What a piece of work is x man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculty ! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals!
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_253_0	But this passage which I shall now read you, and which I can never hear without trembling with pleasure, is too fine except in the mouth of a superb actress :-—
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_254_0	I shall never bear that—good Mirabell, don’t let us be familiar or fond, nor kiss before folks, like my Lady Fadler and Sir Francis: nor go to Hyde Park together the first Sunday in a new chariot, to provoke eyes and whispers ; and then never to be seen there together again; as if we were proud of one another the first week, and asham’d of one another ever after. Let us never visit together, nor go to a play together, but let us be very strange and well-bred : let us be as strange as if we had been married a great while; and as well-bred as if we were not married at all.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_255_0	HELTUBADA. That, too, in form and moving, how express and admirable.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_256_0	BENTUAS. With those phrases echoing in our ears, let us to dinner, to chatter about the newest novel, the League of Nations, and the fascinating failings of our acquaintance: Much remains to say, and yet I have, perhaps, already spoken too long. My different theses, maybe, contradict one another, and much, no doubt, is to recant.
1-5-historiophone	doc_33_257_0	HELTUBADA. Don’t let that trouble you, for speech is the readiest solvent of imposthumous thought. We're not like Charles Lamb’s Scotchman, always speaking on oath. For as Hylas remarked to Philonous during theif incomparable dialogue, ‘‘ Every false step 4 man make in discourse, is not to be insisted on.”

2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_0_0	HUNTING THE HIGHBROW
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_1_0	The highbrow is an extremely unpopular person. The hunt is up in the Press and in the atmosphere, which is used to convey through valves or crystals information, amusement, or strike news to so many happy homes. When I open a paper or listen - in I am continually told that we are all much better fellows — more honest, and clean, and happy, and wise, and English—for being lowbrows. Being, if not a highbrow, at any rate on the side of the highbrows, I am not cheered by the news. But the hunt is so persistent and vocal that it has led me to make certain investigations, of which this paper is the result. The paper might, perhaps, be more accurately called Notes on the Natural History of the Highbrow and on the Reasons for Hunting Him.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_2_0	Let me begin from two attacks upon the unfortunate creature which fell into my hands in the same week, for they will give us an idea of what the quarry appears to be to the hunters. The first is by Mr Gilbert Frankau, the famous novelist, and is entitled ‘‘An Author’s Feelings on Publication Day.” Mr Frankau broadcasted his feelings, and they were subsequently circulated on paper to the Press. Mr Frankau seems to define a highbrow as anyone who does not like the novels written by Mr Frankau. ‘That is not very illuminating, but he goes on to make the following general remarks :—
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_3_0	“If there are any highbrows listening to-night, I suppose they will think that last sentence of mine a most terrible give-away. Highbrows, you see, are funny people. They do not believe there is any good in the great heart of the British public. They consider that the book or play or picture which entertains and educates and pleases and uplifts ninety people out of every hundred cannot possibly have any real artistic merit. They — the highbrows — think that literature is an exclusive thing — rather like one of those ugly statues, or still uglier pictures, which they are always telling us we ought to admire. But such beliefs are not mine. In fact, I am positive that if an author has a really good story to tell, and really interesting characters to put in it, and really interesting scenes to depict, it is his bounden duty to write his tale in such a way that it is comprehensible and entertaining and uplifting to the vast majority of his fellow-countrymen and countrywomen.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_4_0	“I do not believe that literature, or any other art, can be the exclusive property of the few. I feel that a fine book must be the common property of everybody who can read. And I am quite sure that Homer and Virgil and Dante and Shakespeare and Charles Dickens — just to name a few of the world’s greatest story-tellers—did not write for any little clique, or for any highbrow, but straight to the hearts of the majority of the people who could either read or listen to them in their day.”
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_5_0	I will return to this extremely interesting view of the natural history of the highbrow in a moment, but before doing so I want to quote some extracts from an article by Mr Robert Magill, which appeared in a Sunday paper in the same week in which Mr Frankau broadcasted his opinions. After saying that nowadays it is extremely difficult to be a highbrow, “because good stuff is getting so well known,” and “the grocer’s boy dumps a pound of tea on the windowsill while he whistles an excerpt from Beethoven’s Fourth Quartet,” he proceeds:
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_6_0	“It would be well to examine what one means by a highbrow. The real highbrow, of course, is the man who prefers the appeal to his intellect rather than that solely to his senses. But as intellect is rare, and other people also have intellects, this doesn’t always work. Therefore, in his disgust at finding somebody he regards as less intelligent than himself is capable of liking the stuff he likes, he retaliates by trying to persuade himself that he doesn’t like it at all.”
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_7_0	The scientific natural historian often finds that the sportsman has only a vague idea of the nature of the game which he hunts or shoots. The man with a gun includes under the name partridge or snipe, deer or elk, an enormous number of creatures which, the scientist knows, belong to different species or even genera. It will be obvious to anyone with scientific training that those mighty highbrow-hunters, Mr Frankau and Mr Magill, are doing the same thing with the highbrow. It is clear from their own words that they include under the name the following quite distinct species :—
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_8_0	1. Altifrons altifrontissimus, the original, primitive, and real highbrow or intellectual who, as Mr Magill puts it, prefers the appeal to his intellect rather than that solely to his senses.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_9_0	2. Altifrons aestheticus var. severus, the man who only likes what is best in literature, art, and music, or, as Mr Magill puts it, good stuff.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_10_0	3. Altifrons frankauensis, the man who is not entertained and uplifted by the novels of Mr Gilbert Frankau.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_11_0	4. Pseudaltifrons intellectualis, the man who only likes what nobody else can understand.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_12_0	5. Pseudaltifrons aestheticus, the man who, in literature, art, and music, only likes the latest thing or the oldest thing or the thing which the majority dislikes.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_13_0	This rough and preliminary classification already teaches us something important about the natural history of the highbrow. Speaking broadly, there are two distinct families, species, or genera of this animal, and not only is each of these species subdivided into a considerable number of subspecies, but to each has attached itself a parasitic species of pseudo-highbrow which has been forced by the struggle for social existence or distinction to mimic the true highbrow. The chief characteristic of the one species is a marked development of or attachment to the intellect, of the other a peculiar development of aesthetic appreciation.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_14_0	Both Mr Frankau and Mr Magill confuse the intellectual with the aesthetic highbrow, but it is most important for scientific purposes to keep them distinct. For they are not the same animal. It is true that not all male highbrows are impotent or female highbrows sterile, and therefore you occasionally come across a hybrid highbrow, who has all the characteristics of both species. But there is no necessary connection between the intellect and aesthetic appreciation, and therefore there are dozens of intellectual highbrows who are not aesthetic, and dozens of aesthetic highbrows who are not intellectual. Aristotle, William Godwin, Jeremy Bentham are typical examples of the pure altifrons altifrontissimus uncrossed with aestheticus ; poets (Swinburne, for example), artists, and musicians will provide you with many examples of altifrons aestheticus uncrossed with altifrontissimus.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_15_0	The distinction between the two species is important because, although the hunters are not always themselves fully conscious of the fact, each is hunted for a different reason. I propose to deal with the case of aestheticus first. Mr Frankau and Mr Magill between them make it quite clear why the aesthetic highbrow is unpopular. Mr Magill, who is very fair and sportsmanlike, implies that the genuine aesthetic highbrow only likes what is aesthetically “‘good stuff.” But the main charge against him is that he does not like what the great public likes, and Mr Frankau, in summing up and passing sentence on him, lets fall the obzter dictum that only what the great public likes can really be good stuff.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_16_0	The quarrel between the aesthetic highbrow and his hunters is, in fact, concerned with a difference in standards, and it raises aesthetic and psychological problems of considerable intricacy and prices for its private and public art collections.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_17_0	The process is a very mysterious one by which a book, picture, or piece of music either passes into oblivion or becomes a classic, and even more mysterious is the part played in that process by the highbrow and the great heart of the public respectively. Take the five writers mentioned by Mr Frankau. His words make it clear that the Iliad, the Aeneid, the Divine Comedy, King Lear, and Martin Chuzzlewit are all accepted as classics by the anti-highbrow, and are certified as going straight to the hearts of the majority of the people. But it is also clear that of two, at least, of these writers Mr Frankau, the spokesman of the public, has never read a word. No one who had ever read a line of the Aeneid could possibly say that it has a really good story, or that it has really interesting characters, or that it has really interesting scenes. To call Virgil one of the world’s greatest story-tellers is just about as true as to call Aristotle one of the world’s greatest poets. The idea that the 4incid could be comprehensible, entertaining, and uplifting to the vast majority of the Romans of the Augustan age is ludicrous. The number of people who have understood and enjoyed that difficult, boring, absurd, and magnificent book since it was first written some 2000 years ago probably has not yet equalled the number of people who are entertained and uplifted to-day by a popular novel in the first
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_17_1	week after publication. And ninetynine per cent. of the people who understand and enjoy Virgil are highbrows, for if there was ever a highbrow poet who wrote for highbrows it was the man who wrote the Aeneid. Yet here is a highbrow, who can only be understood and appreciated by highbrows and is only read by highbrows, accepted by the highbrow-hunters as a classic, quoted as an example of a popular writer, and miraculously metamorphosized into a popular novelist. Surely a strange phenomenon!
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_18_0	What I have said of Virgil, I believe to be even more true of Dante. Personally, like Mr Frankau, I have never read Dante, but I have often looked at him, and have always decided to reserve him as a book to be read in old age when the evenings will be long and time will move slowly. But I have opened him sufficiently often to see that he is not a great story-teller, that he does not go straight to the heart of the ordinary Fascist, and that you have to have a pretty high brow even to understand him.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_19_0	Let me sum up the position to which my investigations of the habits of altifrons aestheticus have brought me. This animal is attracted by objects which it calls works of art. It professes to like only what Mr Magill calls “‘good stuff,” and it does not seem to enjoy contemporary popular authors, Royal Academy pictures, or the music played by the Savoy Havana Band. It occasionally announces that a contemporary writer, let us say, is producing ‘‘good stuff,” and this is the point at which its behaviour is scientifically interesting. I should say that in the vast majority of cases a writer who is pronounced by altifrons aestheticus var. severus to be a great writer is not accepted as such for an appreciable time by the general public, and that a very large proportion of new writers who are pronounced by contemporary highbrows to be great writers are eventually recognized as such by the great public. You have, then, this curious result, that those who are hunted and derided for their opinions as highbrows are more often than not in the end justified by the opinions of their hunters.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_20_0	To investigate and explain this phenomenon would involve a long discussion of the relation between artistic value and popular appreciation. I must confine myself to a few disjected suggestions. I suggest, first, that the highbrow is genuinely attracted by elements in literature, let us say, which may conveniently be called aesthetic, and which are not primarily interesting or attractive to the great public. I deny that the qualities which make the Aeneid, or King Lear, or the Iliad, or War and Peace, or Paradise Lost, or Madame Bovary, or Emma good stuff have anything to do with such things as really good and uplifting stories, interesting characters, and interesting scenes, though I agree that what the general public primarily wants from a book is a good story and a certain amount of uplift. The highbrow is therefore in literature one of those unpleasant persons whose standards are different from the majority, and that is a very good reason for hunting him.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_21_0	But that is not the most interesting point. The really curious problem is why in the end the standards of aesthetic highbrowism should prevail with the general public. It is indisputable that by far the greater number of books which live and become classics and are universally recognized as masterpieces are books which are good stuff by the standards of highbrows, not by those of the great public. Mr Frankau, when he wanted to think of a masterpiece, thought of the Zneid, not of Two Little Wooden Shoes, which years ago went straight to the great heart of a nation; Mr Magill, when he wanted to think of some musical good stuff, thought of Beethoven’s Fourth Quartet (whatever exactly that may be), not of ‘The Lost Chord,” or even ‘“’Tararaboomdeay.” Every ten years or so tens of thousands of novels, poems, biographies, essays are produced which go straight to the great heart of the world’s public; there for a publishing season of six months they flourish luxuriantly, pouring, I hope, a shower of golden blossoms into the lap of the author and publisher ; but at the end of each publishing season 999 out of every 1000 have died, and at the end of ten years probably not even the name of one of them survives in the memory of anyone except their own authors, while at the end of fifty years even that has perished with the authors. Meanwhile, one or two or three highbrow productions which, with difficulty,
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_21_1	sold 1000 copies to struggle into a second edition after two or three years, will have taken firm root in the heart of the ordinary man, so that at the end of fifty years they are ripe for sanctification in the ‘Temple Classics or Everyman’s Library.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_22_0	I do not pretend that I can give any convincing psychological explanation of this curious phenomenon, but there are one or two points which are worth considering. One of the most obscure points connected with the immortality of highbrowand the mortality of popular literature is this. Why should the good story which goes straight to the heart of one generation practically never go to the heart of any subsequent generation? The highbrow of 1926 reads the £neid, Dante, Paradise Lost, Keats, Crotchet Castle, Meredith, and Erewhon with considerable pleasure; the reader of Mr Frankau’s novels would never dream of reading The Romance of the Forest (Mrs Radcliffe, 7th ed. 1806) The Doctor’s Wife (Miss Braddon, 7th ed. 1866), or Lord Oakburn’s Daughters (Mrs Wood, 1st ed. 1864, 12th 1888). I cannot find any explanation of this fact which really satisfies me. ‘The obvious explanation is that a book which has to make its appeal only through its story and characters and scenes has to be topical. Manners and customs change, and what is a good story in 1806, 1866, or 1888 may well seem simply silly in 1926. There is, of course, some truth in this, but it is certainly not a complete explanation. The Jiiad and Odyssey are still good stories, and so are Pride and Prejudice, Villette, and Wuthering Heights. I am inclined to think that there must be dozens of dead bestsellers which, if they were republished, might be best-sellers again. Perhaps the terrible infantile mortality among
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_22_1	best-sellers is connected with the exigencies of the supply rather than with the tastes of the consumers. A high birthrate is inevitably accompanied by a high death-rate. People who produce books which are comprehensible, entertaining, and uplifting to the vast majority of their fellow-countrymen and countrywomen tend to produce one at least every twelve months, and often go on doing this for twenty or thirty years. If all of them remained best-sellers all the time, the rest of the world would very soon have to spend every hour of the day reading best-sellers in order to keep up with the supply. The only solution is to kill off the old in order to make room for the new. On the other hand, the highbrow is a very slow-breeding animal; he is rarely prolific; he is often in favour of and practises birth control; and there are not very many of him who are actually writing books in any generation. The problems of over-population do not, therefore, apply to highbrow literature. The highbrow considers himself fortunate if one book as good as Crotchet Castle appears in twenty years, or one as good as War and Peace in a century. ‘The consequence is that it is not necessary to kill Paradise Lost in order to find time to read Proust.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_23_0	The most interesting problems are, however, connected with the process by which works which have real artistic merit, according to the standards of aesthetic highbrows, seem eventually to go to the heart of the public and receive the frozen immortality accorded to recognized classics. It should be said at once that Mr Frankau is certainly mistaken on one point. I claim to have as intimate an acquaintance as he has with the modern altifrons aestheticus, and it is certainly untrue that this creature holds that the book, play, or picture which appeals to ninety-nine people out of a hundred cannot possibly have artistic merit. Nearly every modern highbrow, for instance, would say that Dickens was a writer of genius, and it is notorious that his novels have always gone straight to the great heart of the British public. It is true that some very severe aesthetic highbrows would maintain that the qualities which make a book or a picture a great work of art are never those which make it appeal to ninety-nine out of every hundred people. But that is a very different thing from saying that a work which is popular cannot have artistic merit.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_24_0	You have, therefore, to consider two theories which are at the opposite poles to one another. One is that of the most highbrow highbrows, which I have just stated; the other is that of people who believe with Mr Frankau that nothing can be a great work of art which cannot be understood and appreciated by practically all ordinary people. Personally, I incline to think that the truth is too complicated to be covered by such simple and sweeping formulz, and that it lies somewhere between the two extremes. Mr Frankau’s statement is obviously absurd. The eid is indisputably a great poem, but however educated the world might be, it would always exasperate and bore the vast majority of its inhabitants, and in this case I should always number myself among the majority, for in literature often video meliora proboque, but, with ninety-nine people out of a hundred, deteriora sequor. The Phaedrus is, to my mind, a greater work of art than the Aneid, but it is certain that not one per 1000 of the Athenians could have understood and appreciated it when it was written. How many people out of every hundred could truthfully say that they understand and are entertained by Urn Burial, or Donne’s poems, or Paradise Lost, or Tristram Shandy, or, La Bruyére, or Wordsworth’s Prelude, or The Brothers Karamazov, or Proust? And how many people will be prepared to deny that these are great works of literature? No, the idea that popularity is a test
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_24_1	of artistic merit is merely the day-dream of a popular writer. Most great literature is not easy to read or understand; it is often extremely boring; it is very rarely entertaining or amusing. That is why it is rarely read for or with pleasure by the great public and why, when it first appears, it is frequently condemned as mere highbrow stuff by ninety-nine out of every hundred people.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_25_0	On the other hand, I doubt the statement that the qualities which make a book a great work of art never appeal to the vast majority of people. It is probably true that when a book is both a work of art and popular, the qualities which give it aesthetic merit are not those which have most to do with its popularity — but that is a very different thing. Let me give an example. Mr Frankau says that Shakespeare is one of the world’s greatest story-tellers, and in a sense this is true. Shakespeare does sometimes have a good story to tell (though sometimes he has a very bad and muddled one). As a character drawer he is superb, and his scenes, both tragic and comic, are often magnificent. Now I am ready to agree with Mr Frankau that, speaking generally, it is the story and the characters which appeal to the majority of people. But it is absurd to pretend that King Lear is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, play ever written because of its story and characters. If you look upon King Lear as a story it is really silly, and even the characters are not particularly interesting. The aesthetic merits of the play are in fact very little connected with the story, plot, characters, and scenes. In other words, the aesthetic qualities of Shakespeare are not those which primarily appeal to the majority of people.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_26_0	One is still left with the question why, in that case, Shakespeare, and not Miss Dell or Mr Hutchinson, is recognized by the public as the greatest of English writers ? Partly, of course, it is snobbery. The highbrow is abused and hunted and his standards are derided, but the incorrigible snobbery of the human race brings it about that his aesthetic opinions and standards are adopted by his hunters. It is simply not true that the majority of ordinary people understand and appreciate and read Shakespeare; he bores them, and he bores them because he is an intellectual and aesthetic highbrow writing for intellectual and aesthetic highbrows. And what is true of Shakespeare is infinitely more true of most other great writers.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_27_0	Nevertheless, I do not believe that the aesthetic qualities which make a book a great work of art never appeal to the public. For one has to face the fact that it is not merely the highbrows who keep the great corpus of classics in all languages alive. The really popular writers of each generation die, the great writers live, and they live to some extent at any rate in the hearts and speech of the public. Chaucer and Shakespeare and Sterne and Fielding and Jane Austen may not be very widely read, but they are English literature to the non-highbrow as well as to the highbrow. Mrs Radcliffe, Miss Braddon, and Mrs Wood are nothing at all; they are simply dead and buried together with Gower, Thompson, and Southey. That, I think, is a very remarkable fact — not a single non-highbrow secondrate popular writer slips through the highbrow sieve of immortality to be enshrined by the great public as a great writer in the teeth of the highbrows.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_28_0	I cannot believe that this is due merely to the aesthetic dictatorship of the highbrow, or to undiluted snobbery of the non-highbrow. Surely, if that were the case, the ordinary man would have occasionally asserted himself, and we should find that one or two really popular writers, who only write good stories and go straight to the great heart of the public, had crept into immortality. But where are they? I cannot see a single one of them, though I could name dozens of pure highbrows, whom the ordinary man numbers among the world’s great writers. The reason must, I think, be that real artistic merit does have, at any rate to a limited extent, some popular appeal. And if one examines the ordinary non-highbrow attitude towards the classics, ancient and modern, one can see something of the way in which this works.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_29_0	I suggest first that aesthetic qualities, when combined with non-aesthetic qualities which are popular, produce an effect which the ordinary man feels and recognizes as something different from and better than that of popular and ephemeral literature. Thus no first-class novelist is ever as popular as a really bad novelist, because the aesthetic necessities involved in good novel-writing make it impossible for the writer to concentrate his attention on producing a good story and interesting characters, something which will immediately be understood and appreciated by ninetynine out of a hundred persons. But where a great artist can also produce a good story, he will obtain a modified popularity which is quite distinct from that of the mere best-seller, because his ssthetic qualities have their effect. I believe that thousands of non-highbrows appreciate Scott and Jane Austen in a way in which they do not appreciate Mr Hutchinson or Mr Frankau. They get more undiluted pleasure from Mr Hutchinson and Mr Frankau, but from Scott and Jane Austen they get something besides the pleasure of day-dreaming through a good story; they get, in fact, some of that purely aesthetic pleasure which is what appeals to the highbrow. And the non highbrow quite consciously recognizes the distinction; he calls Scott and Jane Austen good stuff. What applies to the novelist also applies to the poet and the essayist. Tennyson was never as popular as Ella Wheeler Wilcox, but in his sentiments and sentimentality he had some of the qualities which have sold
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_29_1	Poems of Passion by the hundred thousand. Those are the qualities which made him a second-class best-seller among poets. But he was also an aesthetic highbrow poet, and as such he is recognized by the non-highbrows; he is good stuff, but Ella Wheeler Wilcox isn’t. Considerable numbers of the great public will read and thrill to “Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean” a hundred years after it was written, but already the other day I saw Mrs Wilcox sinking into oblivion when I bought one of her books reduced to threepence on Smith’s bookstall at Polegate station in Sussex.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_30_0	There is another reason which makes me think that aesthetic merit can accord an author a modified popularity, at any rate if he be dead. It is obvious that new writers, painters, and musicians of great aesthetic originality are not only not appreciated, but are frequently actively disliked by the public when they first appear. A generation later they will apparently be appreciated by hundreds of people who are not highbrows. ‘There was an element in Keats, Wagner, and Cézanne, for instance, an aesthetic element with an immediate appeal to a few highbrows, which at first aroused in ordinary people a genuine and instinctive aversion. Fifty years later the same element produces no such hostile reaction; on the contrary, it appears to give to a considerable number of the public much of the same kind of pleasure as was originally confined to the highbrow. It seems to me unreasonable to believe that the original hostile reaction was genuine and the later pleasure unreal or mere snobbery. The more probable explanation is this: In works of art the qualities which are primarily attractive to the ordinary man are generally not aesthetic. But when he is given sufficient time to grow accustomed to and understand the aesthetic methods and intentions of an artist or a school, the aesthetic merits have their effect upon and their appeal to him. The non-highbrow who has just begun to understand and appreciate Wordsworth or Beethoven finds himself up against something new and disturbing, which he does
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_30_1	not primarily want, when Keats or Wagner swims into his ken—his first reaction is annoyance, and he shows it by deriding any highbrow who may tell him that Keats is a great poet or Wagner a great composer. But give him a little time, and after quarter or half a century he will have grown accustomed to the new rhythms and new methods and will allow them to have their proper, pleasurable effect on him.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_31_0	I do not know that there is very much more to say about altifrons aestheticus, and I still have to deal with altifrons altifrontissimus. Before doing so, however, I suppose that I ought to give a word or two to pseudaltifrons aestheticus. This is not a very interesting animal, whom we have all come across from time to time lurking in the undergrowth of Cambridge, Oxford, Chelsea, Bloomsbury, and other favourable localities. He is really a cross between two genera widely dispersed over the world’s surface, the bore and the snob. Highbrow hunters, who, like all sportsmen, are more interested in killing their game than knowing its habits, always confuse the altifrons aestheticus with the pseudaltifrons aestheticus. ‘They are also mistaken about the numbers and habits of this animal. Pseudaltifrons aestheticus is not, in my fortunate experience, very common, The study of great works of art entails so much tedious labour that bores and snobs usually find other more fruitful fields for their talents and activities. But there are a certain number of hybrid bore-snobs who have fastened upon literature, art, and music as their peculiar habitat. It is not, however, really true that even they, as people like Mr Frankau believe, consider that literature is written for little cliques or is the exclusive property of the few. What is true of them is that, having, with justice, no reliance on their own aesthetic judgments, they are always after the latest thing either in antiquity or modernity—in fact, they are
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_31_1	apt to run off with the crumbs which fall from the table of altifrons aestheticus. And there I propose to leave them.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_32_0	Altifrons altifrontissimus, whom I now have to deal with, is a most formidable animal, very different from the mildmannered and often charming altifrons @stheticus. Weis the intellectual proper, the man who has a passion for the intellect. ‘The reason for hating and hunting him is obvious. Ordinarily an innocuous and slightly ridiculous animal, he may at any moment and in any department of life become a terrible menace.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_33_0	In ordinary times we very rarely think, and the use of the intellect, except for the purpose of finding reasons to support our passions and prejudices, is painful and distasteful to us. But the spectacle of another man using his intellect is much more painful and distasteful to us. By the time that we have arrived at the age of twenty-five most of our opinions are comfortably fixed, but they have not been fixed by reason. They are either prejudices which we have accepted from our surroundings or as reactions against our surroundings, or, if we are clever enough, they are reasons which we have invented in order to prove to ourselves and other people that we are right to do what we want to do. The use of the intellect for any other purpose tends, therefore, to be a very disturbing process, rubbing our prejudices the wrong way and thoroughly upsetting our equanimity. Modern civilisation has devised various extremely effective methods for Prescribing rigid limits to the use of the intellect. The most effective of all methods is education. The object of education seems to be partly to teach children and young people that to think is a dreary and laborious process. In my days education in schools and universities impressed upon us the conviction that the intellect should be used as sparingly as possible, but if used at all, should be exercised exclusively upon such useless subjects as dead languages, or upon subjects like Euclid, which were both
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_33_1	untrue and completely unconnected with anything real.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_34_0	Not only the educational system, but the Press, our party system in politics, the theory of the British Constitution, our legal system, the doctrines of religion and patriotism are all ingeniously calculated to make the use of the intellect suspect and unpopular. Oddly enough, the use of the intellect is really extraordinarily pleasant. The solving of a difficult problem or the working out of an intricate train of thought to a successful conclusion is accompanied by a pleasurable feeling which for intensity of thrill can not unjustly be compared to that which the ordinary person gets from Miss Dell’s novels or Mr Magill’s grocer’s-boy is now said to get from the Fourth Quartet of Beethoven. That the non-highbrow is capable of this pleasure is shown by the popularity of the cross-word puzzle and the acrostic, and by the large number of retired colonels who play chess.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_35_0	Altifrons altifrontissimus, or the high-brow intellectual, is an animal in whom this faculty for enjoying the use of his intellect is abnormally developed. Sometimes he is content to confine the exercise of his intellect to safe subjects, and then, if his mind be of a very high order, you get a chess champion like Dr Lasker, or a mathematician like Newton, or a philosopher like Aristotle. But there have always been a certain number of highbrows who insist upon applying the intellect to all subjects and all departments of life—and then the trouble begins. If you begin to think about religion, or the relation of the sexes, or the party system, or education, or patriotism, you are lost, but, what is much more serious, they are lost too. They are the superstructures of illusions and prejudices, and as soon as reason is applied to their foundations they come down with a crash.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_36_0	Hence the real intellectual is deservedly one of the most unpopular animals in the world. And he is, as I said, unlike the aesthetic highbrow — who is a poor, soft, gentle, long-haired creature — a dangerous and savage beast. In ordinary time, it is true, we usually succeed in cutting his claws and in making him harmless. We do this by the simple method of making him ridiculous. It is not difficult to do. An intellectual in politics, a man who applies his intellect to the doctrines of patriotism and puts his principles into practice, a schoolmaster who taught his pupils only what was true and according to the dictates of reason—these people would all simply make fools of themselves, The man who in the ordinary and actual world of to-day appeals to the intellect naturally suffers the fate which would overtake a drunken man who wandered by accident into a meeting of a Temperance Society, or a lunatic who entered a conference of mental specialists.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_37_0	But the intellectual highbrow is deservedly hated and hunted with an intensity which the hunters of aesthetic highbrows never feel. For, in the first place, altifrons altifrontissimus, when brought to bay, is able to defend himself. Even that is not the worst. Although, in normal times he is or appears to be ridiculous, at rare intervals in the world’s history periods occur in which he becomes an extremely dangerous and powerful animal. ‘This is due to the efficacy of human suffering. In ordinary times, as I have said, people do not think, and either naturally or through education dislike thought. But if you can make people miserable enough, you can eventually induce them to think about the causes of their misery. The whole of history shows both that you have to make people in large bodies extraordinarily miserable before this happens and that if communal misery gets beyond a certain point it does happen. But nothing is so dangerous as thought applied to the structure of society, for once people begin to think, you let in the highbrow, and anything may happen.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_38_0	It is at such periods that the intellectual highbrow becomes a powerful and dangerous animal. At the end of the eighteenth century, and again during the Great War, the sum of human misery reached the point at which quite a large number of people began to think about the causes of their misery and the political and social structure. Naturally that was the opportunity for the intellectual highbrow, who had never been doing anything else and had made himself ridiculous by doing it. The hunted suddenly became a hunter, and President Wilson and Lenin, two magnificent specimens of altifrons altifrontissimus, were, for the moment at least, as powerful as the Tsar, the Kaiser, M. Clemenceau, Mr Lloyd George, or Mr Bottomley. It is true that the moment is never a long one. The difficulty of suddenly changing a world based on prejudice and passion into a world based on reason, the vested interests in unreason, the weight of tradition against reason and the enormous mass of people who have grown up in that tradition—all these things make it inevitable that there is a pretty rapid return to what a famous statesman called a healthy state of affairs—every one for himself and God for us all. ‘The power of the intellectual highbrow therefore soon vanishes, but the memory of him as a formidable animal, the consciousness that there are always those latent and dangerous possibilities in him, remain. He is very properly hunted with some ferocity and vindictiveness.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_39_0	One’s judgment of the intellectual highbrow must depend, I think, very much upon one’s estimate of how far and how widely it is possible that mankind may be induced to apply reason to the arrangement of their communal affairs. If human psychology is such that men in groups will never act rationally towards one another, and will allow no permanent place to reason and intellect in the practical organisation of society, then the sooner altifrons altifrontissimus is exterminated the better for the world. For under such circumstances he is usually a nuisance and at times a positive curse. It is much better that a man should be drunk all the time than that he should be sober for only a few hours once every six months, for during those few hours he will probably behave like a suicidal and homicidal maniac, whereas, if he is perpetually drunk, he will merely be asleep or soddenly stupid. So with society, the administration of minute doses of reason into its constitution is only a useless irritant, and the sudden injection every century or two of large doses completely upsets its balance. On the other hand, if there be any real possibility that man may become a rational, political, and social animal, I should be in favour of preserving and even encouraging the intellectual highbrow. For I remain convinced that if men would allow intellect and reason rather than passion and prejudice to have a say in their communal affairs, a good deal of
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_39_1	the sordid ugliness and misery would disappear from society.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_40_0	I have no space in which to deal further with altifrons altifrontissimus, though there are a good many other interesting questions connected with him. I should have liked, for instance, to say something of the curious process by which the ideas of intellectual highbrows are usually, when new and alive, fiercely rejected by the majority, but, when they are safely dead, are accepted as the last word in social and political wisdom. The process is oddly similar to that by which eventually the standards of the aesthetic highbrow are adopted even by his hunters.
2-5-hunting-highbrow	doc_34_41_0	As for pseudaltifrons intellectualts, nothing much need be said about him. The pseudo-intellectual highbrow bears to the intellectual highbrow the same relation as the pseudo-aesthetic highbrow to the aesthetic. He is a parasite, a hybrid between the bore and the snob, who attaches himself to intellectual things and to altifrons altifrontissimus. I expect that he is rather more numerous than the pseudo-esthetic highbrow. I doubt whether he does much harm; the worst thing about him is that he often writes books which other people are unfortunately compelled to review. Indeed, personally, I prefer him to some of the subspecies of real highbrow. For instance, there is altifrons altifrontissimus var. adelphicus. 'This is a curious small subspecies which has made its appearance in recent times. An extraordinarily highbrow highbrow, it runs about all over the place attracting attention by proclaiming itself to be just an ordinary man, and how much better Life is than Intellect, and how deplorable highbrows are. But I must stop, for if once one begins on the subspecies of highbrow there is no end to it.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_0_0	As I am no psychologist, my presumption in addressing a gathering of professional psychologists seems to call for apology. My defence is that of late years you have managed to make yourselves so interesting to the world at large that you have inevitably attracted the attention of outsiders. You have let off too many fireworks in your back garden to wonder that strangers have been looking over the wall.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_1_0	Before the advent of Dr. Freud you worked for so long in a tranquil and almost deserted solitude that. this invasion of your privacy may be a strange and disturbing experience. As an artist let me assure you that you will get accustomed to it, for we artists have always been absurdly interesting to the outside world, and are, a good many of us, by no means averse from these self-invited guests in our workshops. And to be perfectly frank psychologists are the latest disturbers of our rest and threaten to be not the least importunate.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_2_0	That is one reason why I thought it might be profitable if we arranged together the terms on which you would be not only admitted, but welcomed. Those terms are very simple, they consist of one clause, namely, that before you tell us what we are doing and why we do it, we think you should take the trouble to understand what we think we are doing and why we think we do it, I know how impatient doctors are while the patient is going through his symptoms but he does generally make that concession to human nature. If after that, you can show us that we have got a mistaken notion of our own activities, that we have unconsciously rationalized them and in doing so disguised their true significance, we will listen in all humility.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_3_0	What I have to suggest to you to-night is rather complicated. I will therefore begin by summarizing briefly my main ideas,
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_4_0	(1) The words art and artist are simple enough, but alas they have no sharply defined usage. Artists are a group of people of very different temperaments and some of them are actuated by quite different motives; and exercise quite different psychical activities, from others.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_5_0	(2) I believe that two distinct aims and activities have got classed together under the word art, and that the word artist is used of two distinct groups of men, One of these groups info which I would divide artists is mainly preoccupied with creating a fantasy-world in which the fulfilment of wishes is realised. The other is concerned with the contemplation of formal relations, I believe this latter activity to be as much detached from the instinctive life as any human activity that we know; to be in that respect on a par with science. I consider this latter the distinctive aesthetic activity. I admit that to some extent these two aims may both appear in any given work of art but I believe them to be fundamentally different, if not in their origins, at least in their functions.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_6_0	To begin with let us get clear about the question of origins. No doubt the question of the origin of any phenomenon is of great interest and importance, but it must always be borne in mind that the discovery of the origin is not an explanation of the phenomenon. Origins do not necessarily explain functions. The alimentary canal and the brain both have their origin in the epithelial tissue, but one would give an enquirer a strange idea of the functional importance of the brain in the economy of the body if one only stated that it was originally part of the skin.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_7_0	So if you were to prove that art originated in the sexual feelings of man, that might be a very important and interesting discovery, but it would be no explanation of the significance of art for human life. Not what an organ came from, but what it has come to be, is the most important consideration, though what it came from, and the path it has taken in its progress, may throw a light on what it really is. As an instance take the case of language. Dr. Freud in his lectures quotes a theory of language which I am not qualified to criticize or approve but which sounds to me plausible — it is that when men began to work in groups at wood-cutting, building, or what not, they sweetened their toil by shouting together sounds that had a sexual significance and that gradually these sounds become dissociated from sex and associated with particular actions or objects, and thus the original roots of language came into being. Now to argue from this that language is merely a function of the sex instinct would be grotesque. Since it has come to be the vehicle for the whole discursive intellectual life of man — it has come to serve most of all precisely those activities which are most completely removed from the instinctive life, Indeed all human activities must presumably have their ultimate origins in some part of the purely animal and instinctive life of our earliest ancestors.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_8_0	Science itself, the activity of the pure reflective intellect, no doubt comes from a gradual misapplication and distortion of what was once only a weapon in the struggle for life. What was once hardly more than the animal ingenuity, which enabled man to contrive elementary devices for protection or shelter, has become through that very process of misapplication the purely reflective and disinterested intellectual power of an Einstein or a Freud, and we can show almost every intermediate stage in this long process. Now if you wanted to investigate the real nature this truth-seeking passion of scientific men, it might be important, no doubt, to discover when it first branched off from the instinctive ratiocination of animals, but you could say nothing about its significance unless you studied it beyond the point where it had lost all traces of its subservience to the instinctive life. To understand the scientific activity you must note that its essence is precisely this complete detachment from the instinctive life, its complete uselessness, its abiological nature, since it exists not to serve life but truth, and this is precisely why those who devote themselves to this activity are constantly in conflict with the mass of mankind which is deeply concerned with life and completely indifferent to truth.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_9_0	Now one of the pleas I want to make to you is that, if you wish to discover something about the nature of artistic activity, you should study it at a stage where it has thrown off the traces of its origin, has run clear, as it were, of all these accessory accompaniments which surround and, perhaps, cloak it in its earlier stages.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_10_0	There is such a thing as impure or useful science, and, if you were to analyze that activity, you would find all sorts of biological motives at work, although the fundamental truth-seeking passion of pure science is distinguished precisely by its independence of, and its indifference to, biological necessity.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_11_0	Similarly there is an impure and, perhaps, useful art (though the use of impure art is not so easily demonstrated as that of impure science) ; here too, analysis would reveal a number of elements which really form no part of the essential aesthetic activity, and you will make a serious mistake if, after such an analysis, you declare these to be constituent parts of that phenomenon.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_12_0	If you have a substance which you know to be chemically pure it is clear that you have a right to say that every element which you discover in that substance by analysis is a constituent part of it, but, if you have any reason to suspect an impure mixture, you know that any particular element which the analysis reveals may be due to the impurity and form no part of the substance which you are investigating.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_13_0	Now that the aesthetic activity does mix in various degrees with a number of other activities is surely evident. Take for instance advertisements; many of these show no aesthetic effort and do not even try to afford aesthetic pleasure; they merely convey more or less inaccurate information about a particular object. You can think of advertisements where not only are the merits of the objects enumerated but the object, let us say a bottle of Somebody’s Beer, is depicted. Every detail of the bottle and its label is given so that we may recognize it when we see it in the bar, but there is no sign that in the manner of representation any thought has been expended for our aesthetic pleasure. On the other hand I take certain advertisements in American journals, where advertisements are taken seriously and romantically, and I find a very genuine effort, in the proportion and spacing of the letters, in the harmonious consistence of the forms, and in the exact presentation of the object, towards aesthetic pleasure. None the less this aesthetic appeal is mixed with all sorts of appeals to other feelings than the love of beauty — appeals to our sense of social prestige, to our avarice, to our desire for personal display, and so forth.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_14_0	Or take again the case of dress—here no doubt there is often a considerable care for pure beauty of line and harmony of colour, but such considerations have continually to give place to far more pressing concerns connected with social rivalry, in fact to all the complicated mass of instincts which go to make up what we call snobbishness.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_15_0	These, then, are cases of obvious mixtures, in which the aesthetic impulse has a part — but you will say these belong to applied art; if we take pictures which subserve no ultimate use we shall surely be safe. But alas the vast majority of pictures are not really works of art at all, No doubt in most a careful analysis would reveal some trace of aesthetic preoccupations, but for the most part the appeal they make is to quite other feelings.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_16_0	For the moment I must be dogmatic and declare that the aesthetic emotion is an emotion about form. In certain people, purely formal relations of certain kinds arouse peculiarly profound emotions, or rather I ought to say the recognition by them of particular kinds of formal relations arouse these emotions. Now these emotions about forms may be accompanied by other emotions which have to do more or less with what I call the instinctive life.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_17_0	"The simplest examples of this can be taken from music. If, as frequently happens, an unmusical child strikes six notes in succession on the piano, the chances are that no one would be able to perceive any necessary relation between these notes — they have been struck by accident, as we say. But if I strike the first six notes of ‘‘ God Save The King,"" every one who is not quite music-deaf recognizes that they have, as one would say, a meaning, a purpose. They occur in such a sequence that after each note has been struck we feel that only certain notes can follow and, as the notes follow one another, they more or less adequately fulfil our expectation. i.e., from the beginning the idea of a formal design or scheme is impressed on our minds, and anything which departed violently from that would be not merely meaningless, but an outrage to our sense of order and proportion. We have then an immediate recognition of formal design, of a trend in every part towards a single unity or complete thing which we call the tune."
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_18_0	Now let us suppose that you hear “‘ God Save The King ” for the first time ; it is possible that you would get an emotion from the mere recognition of that formal system. (I do not say it would be a very profound or important emotion, but it might be an emotion, and it would probably stir up no image whatever in your mind, would be associated with no particular person or thing or idea. But those particular notes have become associated with many other things in our minds, so that when they are played we no longer can fix our minds on the form, we are instantly invaded by the associated feelings of loyalty, devotion to country, boredom from the memory of tiresome functions, or relief that we can now at least leave the theatre. We shall say that that particular formal design of notes has become symbolical of numerous other things with which it has become associated.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_19_0	Now this simple case presents in easy form some of the problems which confront us in works of art of all kinds. The form of a work of art has a meaning of its own and the contemplation of the form in and for itself gives rise in some people to a special emotion which does not depend upon the association of the form with anything else what ever. But that form may by various means either by casual opposition or by some resemblance to things or people or ideas in the outside world, become intimately associated in our minds with those other things, and if these things are objects of emotional feeling, we shall get from the contemplation of the form the echo of all the feelings belonging to the associated objects.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_20_0	Now since very few people are so constituted by nature or training as to have developed the special feeling about formal design, and since everyone has in the course of their lives accumulated a vast mass of feeling about all sorts of objects, persons, and ideas, for the greater part of mankind the associated emotions of a work of art are far stronger than the purely aesthetic ones.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_21_0	So far does this go that they hardly notice the form, but pass at once into the world of associated emotions which that form calls up in them. ‘Thus, to go back to our example, the vast majority of people have no notion whether the form of “ God Save The King” is finely constructed and capable of arousing aesthetic emotion or not. They have never, properly speaking, heard the form because they have always passed at once into that richly varied world of racial and social emotion which has gathered round it.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_22_0	And what is true of certain pieces of music is even more true of the graphic arts. Here we have forms which quite visibly resemble certain objects in nature, and not unfrequently these objects, such for instance as a beautiful woman, are charged for us with a great deal of emotion. When to this we add that people are far less sensitive to the meaning of visible formal design than they are to audible design, we need not be surprised that pictures are almost always estimated for qualities which have nothing, or almost nothing, to do with their formal design or their aesthetic quality in the strict sense.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_23_0	To satisfy this emotional pleasure in the associated ideas of images which the mass of mankind feel so strongly there has arisen a vast production of pictures, writings, music, etc., in which formal design is entirely subordinated to the excitation of the emotions associated with objects. And this is what we may call popular, commercial or impure art, and to this category belongs nowadays the vast majority of so called artistic productions. On the other hand in each generation there are likely to be a certain number of people who have a sensitiveness to purely formal relations. To such people these relations have meaning and arouse keen emotions of pleasure. And these people create such systems of formal relations and do not sacrifice willingly or consciously anything of those formal relations to the arousing of emotions connected with objects in the outside world. Their whole attention is directed towards establishing the completest relationship of all the parts within the system of the work of art.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_24_0	It so happens that these systems of formal relations the meaning of which is apprehended by a comparatively few people in each generation, have a curious vitality and longevity, whereas these works in which appeal is made chiefly to the associated ideas of images rarely survive the generation for whose pleasure they were made. This may be because the emotions about objects change more rapidly than the emotions about form. But whatever the reason, the result is that the accumulated and inherited artistic treasure of mankind is made up almost entirely of those works in which formal design is the predominant consideration.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_25_0	This contrast between the nature of inherited art and the mass of contemporary art has become so marked that the word “ classic” is often used (loosely and incorrectly, no doubt) to denote work which has this peculiar character. People speak of classical music, for instance, when they mean the works of any of the great composers. It is significant of the rarity of comprehension of such formal design that to many people classical music is almost synonymous with “ dull’ music.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_26_0	Now what I want to put before you is that the Purposes and methods of these two kinds of art and of the two kinds of artist that produce them are so different—in so many ways so diametrically opposed that when you set out to analyse the nature and function of art by psychological tests, you must know which kind you are dealing with and you must keep your results in separate pigeon-holes or else you will only make confusion worse confounded,
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_27_0	Before I go any further I will turn to what one or two of the psychological authorities have said on the subject. I quote the passage in his introduction to Psycho Analysis in which Dr. Freud speaks of the artist. This is what he says :—
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_28_0	“Before you leave to-day I should like to direct your attention for a moment to a side of phantasy-life of very general interest, There is, in fact a path from phantasy back again to reality, and that is—art. The artist has also an introverted disposition and has not far to go to become neurotic. He is one who is urged on by instinctive needs which are too clamorous ; he longs to attain to honour, power, riches, fame, and the love of women ; but he lacks the means of achieving these gratifications. So, like any other with an unsatisfied longing, he turns away from reality and transfers all his interest, and all his Libido, too, on to the creation of his wishes in life. There must be many factors in combination to prevent this becoming the whole outcome of his development ; it is well known how often artists in particular suffer from partial inhibition of their capacities through neurosis. Probably their constitution is endowed with a powerful capacity for sublimation and with a certain flexibility in the repressions determining the conflict. But the way back to reality is found by the artist thus : He is not the only one who has a life of phantasy ; the intermediate world of phantasy is sanctioned by general human consent, and every hungry soul looks to it for comfort and consolation. But to those who are not artists the gratification that can be drawn from the springs of phantasy is
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_28_1	very limited; their inexorable repressions prevent the enjoyment of all but the meagre daydreams which can become conscious. A true artist has more at his disposal. First of all he understands how to elaborate his day-dreams, so that they lose that personal note which grates upon strange ears and becomes enjoyable to others ; he knows too how to modify them sufficiently so that their origin in prohibited sources is not easily detected. Further, he possesses the mysterious ability to mould his particular material until it expresses the idea of his phantasy faithfully ; and then he knows how to attach to this reflection of his phantasy-life so strong a stream of pleasure that, for a time at least, the repressions are out-balanced and dispelled by it. When he can do all this, he opens out to others the way back to the comfort and consolation of their own unconscious sources of pleasure, and so reaps their gratitude and admiration; then he has won—through his phantasy—what before he could only win in phantasy, honour, power, and the love of women.”
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_29_0	I must ask you to believe that any criticism I make on this passage is not actuated by motives of personal pique. To be called introverted and on the brink of being neurotic does not seriously affect me. Indeed ever since I observed that the only people worth talking to, the only agreeable companions, belonged to the class that morbidly healthy, censorious people classed as neurotic and degenerate, these words have lost all terror for me. All the same I must declare that the portrait of the artist here given is drawn on the lines of a widespread popular fallacy about the “ artistic temperament.”
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_30_0	Most people lead dull, monotonous and conventional lives with inadequate satisfaction of their libido and one of their favourite phantasies is that of the Bohemian — the gay, reckless, devil-may-care fellow who is always kicking over the traces and yet gets toleration and even consideration from the world by reason of a purely magic gift called genius. Now this creature is not altogether a myth — he or something like him does undoubtedly exist — he frequently practises art but he is generally a second-rate artist. He may even be a very brilliant and successful one, but he is none the less a very minor artist. On the other hand almost all the artists who have done anything approaching first-rate work have been thoroughly bourgeois people—leading quiet, unostentatious lives, indifferent to the world’s praise or blame, and far too much interested in their job to spend their time in kicking over the traces.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_31_0	Now all through this passage Dr. Freud is giving us the picture of such a brilliant, successful and essentially impure artist — I need not say that I use the words pure and impure in a strictly aesthetic sense without any reference to sexual morality — i.e., he is an artist who realizes the dream world wherein he and his admirers find an ideal satisfaction of their unsatisfied instincts. He creates images and situations which belong to this dream world wherein we are free to play the rôle which we all think we have somehow missed in actual life.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_32_0	It is quite true that this explains nearly all contemporary artistic creation. You have only to think of the average novel, especially the feuilleton of papers like the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror, and others, which supply every day their pittance of imagined romantic love to hungry girl clerks and housemaids. In fact I believe the most successful and widely read of these (mostly lady) novelists do really day-dream in print, as it were; nothing else would account for their astounding productivity. These people have the fortunate gift of dreaming the average person’s day-dream so that the wish-fulfilment which comes natural to them coincides precisely with the wish-fulfilment of a vast number of the population, Other less fortunate writers have deliberately and consciously to concoct the sort of day-dream that they believe the public want, and these can never be quite the best-sellers.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_33_0	None of these conditions apply to any first-rate novel—the novels that have endured do not represent wish-fulfilment to any considerable extent. They depend on the contrary for their effect upon a peculiar detachment from the instinctive life. Instead of manipulating reality so as to conform to the libido, they note the inexorable sequence in life of cause and effect, they mark the total indifference of fate to all human desires, and they endeavour to derive precisely from that inexorability of fate an altogether different kind of pleasure—the pleasure which consists in the recognition of inevitable sequences; a pleasure which you see corresponds to the pleasure which we found in marking the inevitable sequence of the notes in a tune; in fact again a pleasure derived from the contemplation of the relations and correspondences of form. To give you instances — no one who hoped to get an ideal wishfulfilment would go to Mme. Bovary or Anna Karenina or even Vanity Fair.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_34_0	Another immense art industry of to-day is the Cinema, and here too wish-fulfilment reigns supreme. I remember an advertisement of a Cinema with the legend ‘“‘ Let us live a life in two hours.” This was a clear appeal to the desire to realize ideally what reality had denied, and indeed there can be no doubt about the method and purpose of nearly all the films, at least such as are not definitely comic, since the comic introduces another problem which I cannot go into now.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_35_0	By a process which is mere child’s play in the dream life we instantly identify ourselves with the hero, and then what satisfaction we attain! With what incredible skill and what incredible good fortune we foil the villain’s plot against the heroine, arrive in the nick of time to shoot him dead, and ride off with the heroine either insensible from fear or just able to cling to us for dear life as we cross terrible ravines on a fallen tree-trunk, scale precipices and crash through forests, and always with the certainty of ultimate and triumphant success! But I needn’t labour the point; the theatre with its audience always clamorous for a happy ending is a no less obvious a case.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_36_0	What is more interesting is the question of the real artist’s attitude to all this; for, in so far as he has to depend on his art for his living, he is under the hard compulsion of throwing a sop to the public, and therefore of giving some satisfaction to the dream-life in his creations. The whole question of the artistic conscience centres round this point. It so happens that some great artists have had rather easy artistic consciences. Dickens is a noteworthy case of this and you all know how he deliberately and consciously spoiled one of his novels by yielding to the clamour of the public and giving it a happy ending, though by doing so his broke the sequence which he knew to be aesthetically inevitable.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_37_0	But the mere fact that there is such a conflict between the artist and the general public is a proof that qua artist the creator has other aims than that of wish-fulfilment and that the pleasure which he feels is not thus directly connected with the libido.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_38_0	Freud, however daring some of his generalizations may be, is a man of scrupulous intellectual integrity, and he has generally avoided treating the question of aesthetics and the artistic impulse, knowing, I suppose, that he has not the necessary sensibility and understanding. But other Psycho-analysts have gone further. Dr. Jung devotes a chapter of his psychological types to the artist. I wish I could criticize this, but I frankly confess I do not understand what it is about. Nothing that he says corresponds to any kind of experience which I or, I suspect, any of the artists I have ever known have ever had. In fact, I can find no connection at all with real experience so that I must simply leave it on one side, merely noting by the way that according to Jung Western art implies an extrovert attitude and Eastern art an introvert attitude (Freud you will remember makes all artists introvert). Anyone who knows Oriental and Western Art at all intimately must shudder at the temerity of any such generalization.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_39_0	I quite recognize that a certain positive turn of mind makes me unfitted to follow Jung's speculations and that I am perhaps unfairly neglecting him, I turn to Dr. Pfister and here too, I will confess to a certain prejudice, I find, according to him, that psycho-analysis can only be safely practised by Christians,— all other religions are dissolved by the destructive activity of psycho-analysis—but the Christian religion has the mysterious power of remaining insoluble. This hardly reassures me that Dr. Pfister possesses that intellectual impartiality which Freud so rightly claims as the chief weapon of the man of Science.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_40_0	Well, Dr. Pfister has a chapter on Psycho-Analysis and Art. He had the opportunity to analyze a youth of eighteen, who had apparently come to him for treatment and who was frequently disposed to paint pictures. I will read you a description of a typical example “ The Bridge of Death.”
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_41_0	“A youth is about to leap away from a female corpse on to a bridge lost in a sea of fog, in the midst of which Death is standing. Behind him the sun rises in blood-red splendour. On the right margin two pairs of hands are trying to recall or hold back the hurrying youth!’’
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_42_0	Would you like one more, “ Night’s highest hope ?”
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_43_0	“Night sits as a mother on a rock holding her child on high. Around her lie “spirits of the night’ holding out their hands to her like praying Mahommedans. Rosy-tipped clouds announce the approaching dawn.”
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_44_0	As a result of prolonged investigation of such works Dr. Pfister arrives at the conclusion that :—
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_45_0	“Artistic or poetic inspiration is to be regarded as the manifestation of repressed desires and, as such, formed in accordance with the laws by which Freud grouped the processes participating in the origin of neurotic symptoms, dreams, hallucinations and related phenomena, save that a whole is created, the deeper psychological significance of which, however, is not perfectly clear to the artist.”
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_46_0	“Everything was present,” he adds, “poetic creation, substitution, dramatization. The most entensive use was made of symbolism.” “Everything was present,” I should add, except the faintest glimmer of any artistic feeling. ‘The one thing I should know about this interesting young man’s drawings would have been the extreme improbability that he would ever be the least good as an artist.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_47_0	Indeed from time to time my advice is asked about the drawings of unhappy and dissatisfied young men and women, drawings which are not altogether unlike the improvisations of this Swiss boy, and I invariably recommend them not to take up art, because I know that real artistes, even if they are destined to paint highly imaginative works and to go mad in the end like Van Gogh, generally begin by making an elaborate study of an old pair of boots or something of that kind.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_48_0	I do not for a moment doubt the value of Dr. Pfister’s analysis from the point of view of understanding the nervous troubles of his patient. I should think indeed, that they would be in effect as useful as the study of his dreams, but, precisely in proportion as they were valuable as indications of the patient’s dream life, they were worthless as indications of the nature of real art.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_49_0	"For I come back to this, that nothing is more contrary to the essential aesthetic faculty than the dream. The poet Mallarmé foresaw this long before Freud had revealed the psychological value of dreams, for in his poem in memory of Theophie Gautier he says that ""the spirit of Gautier, the pure poet, now watches over the garden of poetry from which he banishes the Dream, the enemy of his charge."" You notice that in this connection he calls him deliberately the pure poet, knowing that in proportion as poetry becomes impure it accepts the Dream. You notice also that Dr. Pfister quite unknowingly betrays how little he knows what art is really about when he says of his patients work that the most extensive use is made of symbolism. I have elsewhere expressed ; the belief that in a world of symbolists only two kinds of people are entirely opposed to symbolism, and they are the man of science and the artist, since they alone are seeking to make constructions which are completely self-consistent, self-supporting and self-contained constructions which do not stand for something else, but appear to have ultimate value and in that sense to be real. It is, of course, perfectly natural that people should always be looking for symbolism in works of art. Since most people are unable to perceive the meaning of purely formal relations, are unable to derive from them the profound satisfaction that the creator and those that understand him feel, they always"
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_49_1	look for some meaning that can be attached to the values of actual life, they always hope to translate a work of art into terms of ideas with which they are familiar. None the less in proportion as an artist is pure he is opposed to all symbolism.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_50_0	You will have noticed that in all these psycho-analytical enquiries into pictorial art the attention of the investigator is fixed on the nature of the images, on what choice the painter has made of the objects he represents. Now I venture to say that no one who has a real understanding of the art of painting attaches any importance to what we call the subject of a picture — what is represented. To one who feels the language of pictorial form all depends on how it is presented, nothing on what. Rembrandt expressed his profoundest feelings just as well when he painted a carcass hanging up in a butcher’s shop as when he painted the Crucifixion or his mistress. Cézanne who, most of us believe to be the greatest artist of modern times expressed some of his grandest conceptions in pictures of fruit and crockery on a common kitchen table.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_51_0	I remember when this fact became clear to me, and the instance may help to show what I mean. In a loan exhibition I came upon a picture by Chardin. It was a signboard painted to hang outside a druggist’s shop. It represented a number of glass retorts, a still, and various glass bottles, the furniture of a chemist’s laboratory of that time. You will admit that there was not much material for wish-fulfilment (unless the still suggested remote possibilities of alcohol). Well, it gave me a very intense and vivid sensation. Just the shapes of those bottles and their mutual relations gave me the feeling of something immensely grand and impressive and the phrase that came into my mind was “ This is just how I felt when I first saw Michel Angelo’s frescos in the Sistine Chapel.” Those represented the whole history of creation with the tremendous images of Sybils and Prophets, but aesthetically it meant something very similar to Chardin’s glass bottles.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_52_0	And here let me allude to a curious phenomenon which I have frequently noticed, namely that even though at the first shock of a great pictorial design the subject appears to have a great deal to do with one’s emotional reaction, that part of one’s feeling evaporates very quickly ; one soon exhausts the feelings connected by associated ideas with the figures, and what remains, what never grows less nor evaporates, are the feelings dependent on the purely formal relations. This indeed may be the explanation of that curious fact that I alluded to, the persistence throughout the ages of works in which formal perfection is attained, and the rapid disappearance and neglect which is the fate of works that make their chief appeal through the associated ideas of the images.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_53_0	At this point I must try to meet an objection which psycho-analysts are certain to raise. They will say that in my description of popular art I have used the word wish in the ordinary sense of a more or less conscious wish, whereas Freud uses wish of a desire which has been repressed from consciousness and remains active in the unconscious. The true Freudian wish is incapable of direct satisfaction. The typical kind of case is something like this. A middle aged lady finds herself compelled at a certain hour of the day to go into a particular room and arrange all the objects in a particular way. She cannot explain the least why she does it and why she is compelled to perform this senseless act. By psycho-analysis it is discovered that in her extreme youth she was in love with her father and wanted to kill her mother, but that this desire was repressed from consciousness and came out later on in this peculiar and roundabout way. Perhaps both father and mother were dead at the period of her illness, and so any such fulfilment would be impossible but even if alive she has ceased to love her father or be jealous of her mother.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_54_0	"I admit that if you adhere strictly to the use of the word “wish"" in this sense, it is quite possible that Cézanne’s still-life pictures are a sublimation of some such repressed instincts. But you will notice that Freud himself when he talks of the artist neglects entirely his own definition of wish. The wish in this case is the unsatisfied trying for ""fame, power, money, and the love of women.” Now these are not repressed wishes, they are, or may be, clearly allowed in consciousness, and they are capable of direct fulfilment. And he goes on to say that it is only because circumstances do not allow of their direct fulfilment that the artist takes refuge in the phantasy world. Similarly I can guess pretty clearly that Dr. Pfister’s young man’s inventions are inspired by unsatisfied sexual desire and this too is not repressed in the true Freudian sense. In fact I suspect that many difficulties arise from the habit of psycho-analysts of passing from the strict sense of wish to the ordinary sense without even themselves noticing how misleading the results may be. My criticisms therefore, are based on the use that they themselves make of the word in speaking of art."
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_55_0	Now let me assume that you have granted me my main theory at least, in its general outlines—that you admit that while there is an art which corresponds to the dream life, an art in which the phantasy-making power of the libido is at work to produce a wish-fulfilment, there is also an art which has withdrawn itself from the dream, which is concerned with reality, an art therefore which is pre-eminently objective and dis-interested, and which therefore proceeds in the opposite direction from the other kind of art. If you will admit this, the most interesting problems suggests themselves for solution. What is the psychological meaning of this emotion about forms, (which I will call the passion for pure beauty), and what is its relation to the desire for truth which is the only other dis-interested passion we know of — what, if any, are there relations to the libido and the ego?
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_56_0	And here I will indicate a possibility which will have to be considered, a possibility which has often occurred to me, but with regard to which I have never come to any conclusion. I have admitted from the first the great probability, to me almost a certainty, that all psychic energy is divided ultimately from the instinctive life and has its source in the satisfaction, at however distant a remove, of some instinctive need or desire. I suppose, but I do not know, that you would trace the love of abstract truth to the reality principle, although, in its higher forms, it has long lost any biological value and has become an end in itself.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_57_0	I should not be surprised if you were ultimately to trace the love of abstract beauty to the libido, but, even if you should, I should expect you to notice that its relation to that instinctive need is very different from the simple relation of the phantasy-making, dream-like quality of impure, image-making art. For whereas dream-art, if I may use the phrase, is nearly akin to the day-dream and may almost be reckoned as part of the actual instinctive life, the love of beauty implies an almost complete detachment from personality and from the wishes made by our unsatisfied libido.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_58_0	Even if it derives from the libido, it does not seek to satisfy it directly in any way. None the less the question occurs what is the source of the affective quality of certain systems of formal design for those who are sensitive to “pure form. Why are we moved deeply by certain sequences of notes which arouse no suggestion of any experience in actual life? Why are we moved deeply by certain dispositions of space in architecture which refer so far as we can tell to no other experience?
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_59_0	One thing I think we may clearly say, namely, that there is a pleasure in the recognition of order, of inevitability in relations, and that the more complex the relations of which we are able to recognize the inevitable interdependence and correspondence, the greater is the pleasure; this of course will come very near to the pleasure derived from the contemplation of intellectual constructions united by logical inevitability. What the source of that satisfaction is would clearly be a problem for psychology.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_60_0	But in art there is, I think, an affective quality which lies outside that. It is not a mere recognition of order and inter-relation; every part, as well as the whole, becomes suffused with an emotional tone. Now, from our definition of this pure beauty, the emotional tone is not due to any recognizable reminiscence or suggestion of the emotional experiences of life; but I sometimes wonder if it nevertheless does not get its force from arousing some very deep, very vague, and immensely generalized reminiscences. It looks as though art had got access to the substratum of all the emotional colours of life, to something which underlies all the particular and specialized emotions of actual life. It seems to derive an emotional energy from the very conditions of our existence by its revelation of an emotional significance in time and space. Or it may be that art really calls up, as it were, the residual traces left on the spirit by the different emotions of life, without however recalling the actual experiences, so that we get an echo of the emotion without the limitation and particular direction which it had in experience.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_61_0	But these are the wild speculations of an amateur. It is just here that we are waiting and longing for you to step in with your precise technique and your methodical control.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_62_0	I do not pretend that either artists or art critics have made much of a job of aesthetics. We have started innumerable theories and abandoned them again without getting at any very positive and assured results. But we have of late, I think, been able to make a little clearing in the approaches to these problems by analysing a little more clearly than the older writers what goes on inside us when we are confronted by different kinds of works of art and by knowing, or trying to know, or thinking we know, what, as artists, we are after.
1-2-artist-and-psychoanalysis	doc_35_63_0	I expect and desire that you will test everything which we say about ourselves and our aims as ruthlessly as you test your patients’ statements about their own motives, but at least I hope I have shown that it is important to know what class of objects we have in view when we talk of works of art; to know that, if you analyse the pictures of let us say the Royal Academy, your remarks may interest us on other grounds, but not for the light they throw on the aesthetic process in itself.
